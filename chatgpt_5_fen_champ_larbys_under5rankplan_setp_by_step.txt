Weapon usage in hunts:  
1 target – Fell Blade + Darkite (Tell Blade if over‑accurate to save balance)  
2+ in arc – Labrys + Darkite (Atkite if missing)  
Stalling – Equip Balthite; if still stalling, add Regia in long‑term plan  
Under pressure – Equip Dethite for defense

If you want, I can also give you a **single‑line condensed version** of this so you can paste it into a Clan Lord training tracker or spreadsheet without formatting. Would you like me to make that next?

2/24/25 7:01:44p Mysteree says, "In some ways that sounds like what you all have said about the origin of the Ethereal Plane"
2/24/25 7:01:53p Mysteree says, "More and more things began to occupy it"
2/24/25 7:02:01p Mysteree says, "and that made it ... denser"
2/24/25 7:02:03p Melben says, "that is because of the darshak, I believe at least"
2/24/25 7:02:05p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:02:23p Melben says, "first the Brion's thicken the soup, then the darshak killed the cook."
2/24/25 7:02:32p (Feodoric chuckles.)
2/24/25 7:02:34p (Mysteree chuckles)
2/24/25 7:02:40p Mysteree asks, "But they thickened the soup, aye?"
2/24/25 7:02:45p Mysteree asks, "They did not invent it?"
2/24/25 7:02:45p Melben says, "I think so"
2/24/25 7:02:46p Feodoric says, "Well, by the sounds of it, it was -our- presence that thickened the soup"
2/24/25 7:02:49p Mysteree asks, "or create it?"
2/24/25 7:02:57p You gave signed good karma to Whirl wind, Thanks for coming!
2/24/25 7:18:24p You just received good karma from Whirl wind.
2/24/25 7:18:25p Mysteree says, "this is truly fascinating"
2/24/25 7:18:27p You have a cupful of good karma, and you have given a phial of good karma. You have no karma to give.
2/24/25 7:18:30p Whirl wind is no longer Clanning.
2/24/25 7:18:35p Melben says, "Well I for one am still hung up on the ethereal clouds instead of blanket... ^_^"
2/24/25 7:18:50p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:18:52p (Mysteree nods)
2/24/25 7:18:53p Wayfarer asks, "do the 'brions view us as different from the Darshak, or the same?"
2/24/25 7:18:54p Melben says, "that idea would explain why Mobius hasn't travelled here."
2/24/25 7:18:58p Mysteree says, "that is an interesting phenomenon"
2/24/25 7:19:18p Melben says, "different I hope Wayfarer..."
2/24/25 7:19:23p Melben says, "but I always remember Umbrion's comment..."
2/24/25 7:19:24p Feodoric says, "The 'brions do distinguish between us and the Darshak"
2/24/25 7:19:34p Melben says, "He called us "two eye'd orga". ^_^"
2/24/25 7:19:36p Feodoric says, "At least, most of them"
2/24/25 7:19:39p (Mysteree grins)
2/24/25 7:19:41p Wayfarer says, "hm."
2/24/25 7:19:49p Feodoric says, "It's probably all the same to someone like Umbrion, indeed"
2/24/25 7:19:55p Ansset exclaims, "Apologies, I must be going. Thank you for letting me sit in!"
2/24/25 7:19:57p (Feodoric waves.)
2/24/25 7:20:02p You just received good karma from Ansset.
2/24/25 7:20:02p You gave anonymous good karma to Ansset.
2/24/25 7:20:10p Melben ponders, "was good to see him"
2/24/25 7:20:15p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:20:22p Baffina is now Clanning.
2/24/25 7:20:59p Feodoric says, "Oh, something else I thought of"
2/24/25 7:21:04p Melben asks, "anyone taken ether readings at Peaceton?"
2/24/25 7:21:11p Melben asks, "Yes?"
2/24/25 7:21:14p Feodoric says, "Relating to the sensitivity of the ether to the mind."
2/24/25 7:21:19p Melben says, "ooo"
2/24/25 7:21:25p (Mysteree listens)
2/24/25 7:21:30p Feodoric says, "Perhaps this is why mystics are uniquely fitted to manipulate the ether."
2/24/25 7:21:39p Ansset is no longer Clanning.
2/24/25 7:21:40p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:22:05p Feodoric says, "By using the amulets in particular."
2/24/25 7:22:24p Feodoric says, "Which Tenebrion called a kind of focusing lens for the ether"
2/24/25 7:22:32p Melben ponders, "which it is"
2/24/25 7:22:41p Melben says, "remember"
2/24/25 7:22:59p Melben says, "the element always leaves a residual effect."
2/24/25 7:23:05p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:23:07p Melben says, "whether detected or not"
2/24/25 7:23:13p Baffina is no longer Clanning.
2/24/25 7:23:17p Melben says, "but continue. ^_^"
2/24/25 7:23:20p Baffette is now Clanning.
2/24/25 7:23:31p Feodoric says, "That was more or less the whole of my thought."
2/24/25 7:23:37p Mysteree says, "That just triggered another memory. I came across a reference in Baba jaga's library once "Note that Tenebrion has said earlier that one can pass between planes from the ethereal plane at the places of densest Ether.""
2/24/25 7:23:49p (Melben smiles)
2/24/25 7:23:50p Feodoric says, "Ah, yes."
2/24/25 7:24:00p Baffette thinks, "omw"
2/24/25 7:24:01p Feodoric says, "I was going to bring up that quote in a class to come."
2/24/25 7:24:06p Feodoric says, "It's a good one."
2/24/25 7:24:13p Melben says, "and then they became too dense and seeped through, bam ether war ^_^"
2/24/25 7:24:16p (Wayfarer ponders)
2/24/25 7:24:30p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:24:36p Wayfarer says, "I have an amulet, but I've always been afraid to use it, with no training, for fear of breaking it."
2/24/25 7:25:02p Melben says, "just wearing it lets you anchor to that element."
2/24/25 7:25:06p Feodoric says, "I know it won't necessarily break."
2/24/25 7:25:11p Melben says, "you are uses it by wearing it ^_^"
2/24/25 7:25:18p Feodoric says, "But beyond that I don't know how dangerous it would be for you"
2/24/25 7:25:21p Melben says, "but I would not experiment too much without training."
2/24/25 7:25:35p Wayfarer says, "that was my thought, Melben"
2/24/25 7:25:55p Melben ponders, "Heck I have what is 6 months of training to me, and sunstones still blow up in my face. ^_^"
2/24/25 7:25:55p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:26:05p Feodoric says, "The basic ten ranks in ethereal studies seems enough to avoid blowing them up all the time."
2/24/25 7:26:12p Feodoric ponders, "I still do it though."
2/24/25 7:26:17p Wayfarer says, "hm."
2/24/25 7:26:41p Drablak says, "The ether here is rather low. [Ω=-3]"
2/24/25 7:26:50p Mysteree says, "interesting"
2/24/25 7:26:57p Mysteree says, "It changed over time"
2/24/25 7:27:00p Wayfarer says, "interesting. 4 was high, now 3 is low"
2/24/25 7:27:01p Melben asks, "Have readings been taken at Peaceton?"
2/24/25 7:27:09p Drablak says, "it is minus 3"
2/24/25 7:27:09p Feodoric says, "Minus 3, Wayfarer"
2/24/25 7:27:10p Mysteree says, "I see why you said it was like the wind"
2/24/25 7:27:15p Wayfarer says, "ah"
2/24/25 7:27:20p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:27:22p Wayfarer says, "so it is"
2/24/25 7:27:26p Suu'ub III thinks, "Aye'cha's latest piece on display in the NNK gallery, should check it out, some hot fuzz: http://nekonokessha.wordpress.com/"
2/24/25 7:27:31p Mysteree asks, "But is it random?"
2/24/25 7:27:34p Feodoric says, "Anyone know about ether on Peaceton? I don't"
2/24/25 7:27:35p Mysteree asks, "Or does it oscillate?"
2/24/25 7:27:37p Drablak says, "and it's my scale, the amulet does not give that :¬)"
2/24/25 7:27:49p Mysteree asks, "as if a door was on the surface of a sphere and rotating?"
2/24/25 7:27:57p Wayfarer says, "oh"
2/24/25 7:27:58p Drablak says, "I have not tested ether flow on Peaceton"
2/24/25 7:28:00p Melben thinks, "Wow"
2/24/25 7:28:30p Melben says, "I wonder about this ether cloud theory over envelopement"
2/24/25 7:28:35p Mysteree says, "These are good experiments"
2/24/25 7:28:37p Drablak says, "it seems random Mysteree"
2/24/25 7:28:45p • You can no longer train with Leladar.
2/24/25 7:28:46p (Mysteree nods)
2/24/25 7:28:55p Melben says, "if its like the wind, then it should envelope the Earth"
2/24/25 7:28:56p Feodoric says, "The brions have only been worried about consistent high readings, I believe"
2/24/25 7:29:06p Feodoric says, "Which would imply fluctuation is normal"
2/24/25 7:29:07p (Mysteree nods at Melben)
2/24/25 7:29:10p Drablak says, "I have looked all over Puddleby to see if Leh Lines would affect the flow"
2/24/25 7:29:19p (Melben smiles)
2/24/25 7:29:28p Mysteree asks, "Do they?"
2/24/25 7:29:28p Drablak says, "and found no corelation"
2/24/25 7:29:34p Mysteree asks, "How about on Cloud?"

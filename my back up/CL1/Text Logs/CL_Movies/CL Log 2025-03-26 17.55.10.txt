3/26/25 5:56:23p Feodoric says, "Fantastic, this is a great turnout."
3/26/25 5:56:29p Feodoric says, "For the first university class in a long time."
3/26/25 5:56:31p (Sunblaze was curious.)
3/26/25 5:56:41p Feodoric says, "Thanks for coming."
3/26/25 5:56:51p Feodoric says, "Welcome to the first of six classes on everything you ever wanted to know about the ethereal plane."
3/26/25 5:57:02p Harper ponders, "but were afraid to ask"
3/26/25 5:57:14p Feodoric says, "As you might have heard, my name is Feodoric Mermeios."
3/26/25 5:57:27p Feodoric says, "I’ll be in charge of gathering what exiles know about the plane"
3/26/25 5:57:35p Feodoric says, "and channeling that knowledge directly into your minds"
3/26/25 5:57:43p (Zelkhorn grins.)
3/26/25 5:57:44p Feodoric says, "by means of the ancient mystic technique of talking a lot."
3/26/25 5:57:45p (Wayfarer chuckles)
3/26/25 5:57:53p (Harper grins)
3/26/25 5:57:58p (Drablak smiles)
3/26/25 5:58:08p Feodoric says, "You will be in charge of listening, asking questions and keeping us all alive on the field trips."
3/26/25 5:58:08p (Harper waves)
3/26/25 5:58:08p (CmdrGuard takes a seat.)
3/26/25 5:58:09p Borzon ponders, "I could be a mystic!"
3/26/25 5:58:15p (CmdrGuard waves)
3/26/25 5:58:16p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 5:58:26p Harper ponders, "Keeping us alive ..."
3/26/25 5:58:30p CmdrGuard ponders, "What'd I miss"
3/26/25 5:58:32p Feodoric says, "We'll see how that goes."
3/26/25 5:58:39p Feodoric says, "We’ll meet each week at this time, usually at this place,"
3/26/25 5:58:48p CmdrGuard says, ":P"
3/26/25 5:58:52p Feodoric says, "I’ll talk and answer questions for half an hour to an hour,"
3/26/25 5:59:05p Feodoric says, "then we’ll go on an expedition to somewhere relevant to the class,"
3/26/25 5:59:17p (Emer raises her hand)
3/26/25 5:59:20p Feodoric exclaims, "Usually the Ethereal Plane!"
3/26/25 5:59:21p (Wayfarer takes notes)
3/26/25 5:59:25p Feodoric asks, "Yes, Emer?"
3/26/25 5:59:25p (CmdrGuard doodles)
3/26/25 5:59:30p Emer asks, "will there be a test?"
3/26/25 5:59:36p Emer ponders, "please say no!"
3/26/25 6:05:23p Feodoric says, "There will be no test."
3/26/25 6:05:29p Emer says, "phew"
3/26/25 6:05:29p Phiros ponders, "darn"
3/26/25 6:05:31p CmdrGuard ponders, "Asking about tests? That's a paddeling..."
3/26/25 6:05:33p Drablak ponders, "survival test"
3/26/25 6:05:35p Feodoric says, "That is...."
3/26/25 6:05:42p Feodoric says, "If there IS a test, you'll find out afterwards"
3/26/25 6:05:43p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:05:43p CmdrGuard ponders, "Paddeling the puddleby boats... oh you better believe that's a paddeling"
3/26/25 6:05:43p (Zelkhorn narrows his eyes.)
3/26/25 6:05:44p Emer ponders, "meep!"
3/26/25 6:05:44p (Harper chuckles)
3/26/25 6:05:44p Lily Fren ponders, "Worst. Teacher. Ever."
3/26/25 6:05:46p Zelkhorn ponders, "Mystics."
3/26/25 6:05:46p Feodoric ponders, "Bwea ha"
3/26/25 6:05:47p Whirl wind ponders, "Sneaky"
3/26/25 6:05:47p Feodoric ponders, "Bwa ha"
3/26/25 6:05:50p Feodoric says, "What I’m going to tell you is based on the work of ethereal explorers and scholars"
3/26/25 6:05:51p Feodoric says, "from the last 40 years."
3/26/25 6:05:53p Feodoric says, "I’m going to stick to the known facts as much as possible."
3/26/25 6:05:56p Feodoric says, "The ethereal plane is a great inspiration for wild theorizing,"
3/26/25 6:05:59p Feodoric says, "but my purpose (this time) is to educate and not bore and confuse you."
3/26/25 6:06:00p Harper ponders, "Prowl's domain"
3/26/25 6:06:03p Feodoric says, "For mystics like myself who enjoy boredom and confusion,"
3/26/25 6:06:05p Feodoric says, "I will be holding some additional seminars dedicated to that very purpose."
3/26/25 6:06:07p (Feodoric grins.)
3/26/25 6:06:08p (Harper's pointed ears perk up)
3/26/25 6:06:08p (Drablak smiles)
3/26/25 6:06:10p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:06:11p Feodoric exclaims, "Now, down to business!"
3/26/25 6:06:13p Feodoric says, "Today I’ll be talking about the most basic topics:"
3/26/25 6:06:15p Feodoric says, "what the EP is and how to get around in it."
3/26/25 6:06:16p (Wayfarer sits up straighter)
3/26/25 6:06:20p Feodoric says, "The ethereal plane is a plane of existence"
3/26/25 6:06:23p Feodoric says, "just like our own physical plane, Purgatory, the Astral Plane and the Abyss."
3/26/25 6:06:28p (Harper raises her hand)
3/26/25 6:06:29p Feodoric asks, "Harper?"
3/26/25 6:06:29p Harper asks, "Are there only 5 planes?"
3/26/25 6:06:35p Feodoric says, "According to the 'brion brother, who study such things, there are many more"
3/26/25 6:06:37p Feodoric says, "Perhaps even an infinite number."
3/26/25 6:06:39p (Emer blinks)
3/26/25 6:06:40p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:06:41p (CmdrGuard raises his hand.)
3/26/25 6:06:41p Feodoric says, "Those are the ones that are most familiar to us."
3/26/25 6:06:41p (Harper erases a half baked idea)
3/26/25 6:06:42p Wayfarer ponders, "that's a lot of exploring to do"
3/26/25 6:06:43p Feodoric asks, "Cmdr?"
3/26/25 6:06:44p CmdrGuard asks, "What is the abyss?"
3/26/25 6:06:47p (Harper smiles a slow wide smile)
3/26/25 6:06:47p Zelkhorn ponders, "Detention."
3/26/25 6:06:47p Feodoric says, "A wonderful wonderful place full of demonic undine"
3/26/25 6:06:51p CmdrGuard asks, "And the astral plane?"
3/26/25 6:06:53p Feodoric says, "A very boring place connected with the Abyss"
3/26/25 6:06:55p CmdrGuard says, "Thank you."
3/26/25 6:06:56p (Feodoric smiles.)
3/26/25 6:06:58p Borzon ponders, "I'll give you a chainride there if you keep asking these questions ;)"
3/26/25 6:06:59p Feodoric says, "The Darshak have a way to get to both via their Ash Island temple"
3/26/25 6:07:01p CmdrGuard ponders, "hahah"
3/26/25 6:07:02p Feodoric says, "The easiest way to think about planes is to think about them as places"
3/26/25 6:07:04p CmdrGuard ponders, "If the undine are given dinner, do they become the dined?"
3/26/25 6:07:04p Feodoric says, "places that can’t be reached by ordinary means"
3/26/25 6:07:06p Feodoric says, "and follow different rules from the world we know."
3/26/25 6:07:09p Feodoric asks, "What are the rules of the Ethereal Plane then?"
3/26/25 6:07:09p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:07:12p Feodoric says, "It is a grey, empty, uniform, inhospitable, and alien place"
3/26/25 6:07:15p Feodoric says, "-- rather like Purgatory in these respects."
3/26/25 6:07:18p Feodoric says, "It is filled with a substance or energy known as ether,"
3/26/25 6:07:18p Melben is now Clanning.
3/26/25 6:07:21p Feodoric says, "which blows through the plane like wind"
3/26/25 6:07:23p Feodoric says, "and coalesces to create many dangerous beings."
3/26/25 6:07:26p Feodoric says, "The whole plane is far smaller than our physical world."
3/26/25 6:07:29p Feodoric says, "That's assuming that exiles have seen all of it there is to see."
3/26/25 6:07:34p Feodoric says, "The whole thing is a large square of 81 snells of exactly the same size and shape."
3/26/25 6:07:38p Fiona is now Clanning.
3/26/25 6:07:39p Feodoric says, "Each one is a large octagon."
3/26/25 6:07:39p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:07:41p (Borzon raises his hand)
3/26/25 6:07:43p Feodoric asks, "Yes, Borzon?"
3/26/25 6:07:45p Borzon says, "Well as you said"
3/26/25 6:07:45p (Melben walks in late, embarrassed.)
3/26/25 6:07:46p (Drablak waves)
3/26/25 6:07:48p Borzon says, "The ethereal plane is mostly empty"
3/26/25 6:07:49p (Feodoric nods.)
3/26/25 6:07:52p Borzon says, "and it lacks flora"
3/26/25 6:07:54p Harper ponders, "Octogon"
3/26/25 6:07:54p Gloria whispers, "Hi!"
3/26/25 6:07:54p Borzon says, "which means there is no oxygen"
3/26/25 6:07:57p Melben whispers, "hello, I hope I am not imposing"
3/26/25 6:07:58p Borzon asks, "so I guess we're able to breaht ether?"
3/26/25 6:07:58p Feodoric says, "Exiles do seem to be able to survive there."
3/26/25 6:07:59p Borzon asks, "so I guess we're able to breath ether?"
3/26/25 6:08:00p (Gloria smiles.)
3/26/25 6:08:01p (CmdrGuard listens)
3/26/25 6:08:03p (CmdrGuard listens... to avoid being disconnected.)
3/26/25 6:08:05p Feodoric says, "How it's possible to survive there is an unsolved mystery."
3/26/25 6:08:08p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:08:09p Feodoric says, "Perhaps the atmosphere contains more than ether naturally."
3/26/25 6:08:15p Melben says, "perhaps spirits are bound by different rules in the EP ^_^"
3/26/25 6:08:16p (Zelkhorn raises his hand, somewhat hesitantly.)
3/26/25 6:08:16p Feodoric says, "Ether does seem to be rather different from a gas, however."
3/26/25 6:08:18p Wayfarer ponders, "or perhaps the ether transforms into oxygen somehow when we breathe it"
3/26/25 6:08:19p Feodoric asks, "Mister Zelkhorn?"
3/26/25 6:08:20p Var exclaims, "there is flora in the tower gardens!"
3/26/25 6:08:22p Harper ponders, "Or we are transformed once in the ethereal plane"
3/26/25 6:08:22p Zelkhorn says, "Well, I was wondering."
3/26/25 6:08:22p Drablak says, "hello :¬)"
3/26/25 6:08:25p Zelkhorn says, "You mentioned all those critters that wander around the plane."
3/26/25 6:08:26p (Feodoric nods.)
3/26/25 6:08:27p Feodoric says, "We'll get to meet some later."
3/26/25 6:08:27p Zelkhorn says, "Why are they what they are? Scarmis, for example."
3/26/25 6:08:30p Feodoric says, "Good question."
3/26/25 6:08:30p (Harper smiles at the Dean.)
3/26/25 6:08:31p Feodoric says, "I'll talk about that a bit at the end, if there's time."
3/26/25 6:08:32p Wayfarer ponders, "a question for the gods"
3/26/25 6:08:32p (Zelkhorn nods.)
3/26/25 6:08:37p Feodoric says, "First, I'd like to cover the basic shape of the place"
3/26/25 6:08:38p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:08:39p Feodoric says, "So, we've got our octagons."
3/26/25 6:08:39p (Harper writes down Zelkhorn's question to use as the central thesis of her research grant proposal.)
3/26/25 6:08:41p Feodoric says, "This means you can move to another snell in one of eight different directions,"
3/26/25 6:08:43p Feodoric says, "instead of the usual four."
3/26/25 6:08:50p Feodoric says, "The 81 snells are organized into groups of nine"
3/26/25 6:08:51p Harper exclaims, "81 snell!"
3/26/25 6:08:53p Feodoric says, "It can be hard to visualize this until you go there, so until then..."
3/26/25 6:08:53p (Sunblaze snickers)
3/26/25 6:08:56p (Harper erases her previous diagram)
3/26/25 6:08:58p Feodoric says, "For people who have not been to the plane, I have prepared this chart."
3/26/25 6:09:01p (Feodoric holds up a map.)
3/26/25 6:09:01p (Feodoric): http://h3o.ca/bb/download/file.php?id=7
3/26/25 6:09:04p Feodoric says, "Take a look."
3/26/25 6:09:05p Sunblaze asks, "Mrr?"
3/26/25 6:09:07p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:09:30p Feodoric ponders, "i.e. follow the link"
3/26/25 6:09:31p Emer ponders, "not authorized to view this..."
3/26/25 6:09:31p Wayfarer says, "hm. not authorized"
3/26/25 6:09:31p Phiros says, "The map seems to be coded with strange ruins."
3/26/25 6:09:32p Fiona asks, "must sign in?"
3/26/25 6:09:32p Feodoric ponders, "Oops!"
3/26/25 6:09:33p (Gloria squints at the map.)
3/26/25 6:09:34p (Var waves is hands in the air. Glowing runes appear and gently fade)
3/26/25 6:09:35p (Emer giggles)
3/26/25 6:09:35p (Melben smiles at the good nature of the exiles.)
3/26/25 6:09:36p (Feodoric looks at his chart, disamyed.)
3/26/25 6:09:36p (Feodoric looks at his chart, dismayed)
3/26/25 6:09:42p Harper says, "It is all right, Feo. We can copy the maps and pass them out after class if you would like."
3/26/25 6:09:45p (Melben nods)
3/26/25 6:09:45p Kenegluk is no longer Clanning.
3/26/25 6:09:46p Feodoric says, "The Hel Tree Order is working on a solution."
3/26/25 6:09:48p (Feodoric smiles at his clan mates.)
3/26/25 6:09:48p (Harper smiles approvingly)
3/26/25 6:09:49p Feodoric says, "I'll move on for now."
3/26/25 6:09:50p Wayfarer says, "years ago, I found maps of the ethereal plane in the library, but then they disappeared."
3/26/25 6:09:51p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:09:54p (Feodoric nods.)
3/26/25 6:09:55p (Harper's brows raise.)
3/26/25 6:09:56p Harper asks, "Disappeared?"
3/26/25 6:09:56p Feodoric says, "This isn't a complete map, just a basic outline."
3/26/25 6:09:57p Wayfarer says, "yes, Harper"
3/26/25 6:09:57p Melben ponders, "81 snells is a ton"
3/26/25 6:10:05p Sunblaze says, "Was it from an exile that disappeared for a long time."
3/26/25 6:10:05p Harper says, "ooooh"
3/26/25 6:10:05p Fiona says, "unfortunately many scroll locations have disappeared"
3/26/25 6:10:07p (Harper nods slowly)
3/26/25 6:10:07p Feodoric says, "Moving on, for now"
3/26/25 6:10:08p Feodoric says, "Each group of nine snells is called a sphere."
3/26/25 6:10:08p Wayfarer says, "no, actually, they were from an exile who is still here"
3/26/25 6:10:08p IHael'du ponders, "how do you count 81 snells of nothing?"
3/26/25 6:10:10p Feodoric says, "and each snell in that group is called a sector."
3/26/25 6:10:10p Sunblaze asks, "Mrr?"
3/26/25 6:10:11p Wayfarer ponders, "in groups of nine"
3/26/25 6:10:11p Feodoric ponders, "Oops"
3/26/25 6:10:12p Melben says, "I see"
3/26/25 6:10:12p Harper exclaims, "oh!"
3/26/25 6:10:12p Feodoric ponders, "Not running away, I swear"
3/26/25 6:10:13p (Wayfarer chuckles)
3/26/25 6:10:14p Sunblaze says, "Silly mammal"
3/26/25 6:10:14p (Gloria giggles.)
3/26/25 6:10:14p Harper says, "9 snells = 1 sphere"
3/26/25 6:10:14p Feodoric says, "The spheres are numbered “first”, “second”, “third” and so on, up to the ninth."
3/26/25 6:10:15p (Feodoric nods to Harper.)
3/26/25 6:10:15p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:10:16p Melben ponders, "so a snell in the ep is a sector?"
3/26/25 6:10:16p (Harper redraws her diagram)
3/26/25 6:10:17p Wayfarer asks, "an octagonal sphere?"
3/26/25 6:10:17p Feodoric ponders, "Melben is correct"
3/26/25 6:10:19p Fiona asks, "is there a neutral zone?"
3/26/25 6:10:20p Feodoric asks, "How do you mean, Fiona?"
3/26/25 6:10:20p (Zelkhorn sneaks a swig of warm ale from a poorly-concealed mug.)
3/26/25 6:10:21p Fiona says, "sorry, was thinking is science fiction"
3/26/25 6:10:22p Feodoric exclaims, "Ok!"
3/26/25 6:10:22p Borzon ponders, "just imagine a game of sudoku, it's basicly that."
3/26/25 6:10:22p (Feodoric smiles)
3/26/25 6:10:22p (Emer laughs)
3/26/25 6:10:22p Feodoric says, "The first sphere is in the center of the plane and the others are in a circle surrounding it."
3/26/25 6:10:23p Melben ponders, "she was worried about romulans invading ^_^"
3/26/25 6:10:25p (CmdrGuard listens)
3/26/25 6:10:25p Feodoric says, "This is all on the chart."
3/26/25 6:10:26p Feodoric says, "Which you might see soon."
3/26/25 6:10:26p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:10:26p (Feodoric smiles.)
3/26/25 6:10:27p Phiros ponders, "yIDaQo' umqu' ghot tlhInganpu'..."
3/26/25 6:10:27p CmdrGuard ponders, "The projector always breaks in class..."
3/26/25 6:11:17p Feodoric says, "Spheres (that's the groups of nine) are often referred to by EP1, EP2, EP3 etc."
3/26/25 6:11:18p Farb is now Clanning.
3/26/25 6:11:18p Melben asks, "which is the deadliest sphere?"
3/26/25 6:11:20p Feodoric says, "The 8th is probably the worst."
3/26/25 6:11:21p Melben says, "sorry I should save my questions for the Q and A ^_^"
3/26/25 6:11:21p Feodoric says, "We probably won't be going there."

3/26/25 6:11:22p Emer ponders, "probably?"
3/26/25 6:11:23p Sunblaze asks, "Mrr?"
3/26/25 6:11:23p Feodoric says, "Within each sphere,"
3/26/25 6:11:25p Melben whispers, "aha"
3/26/25 6:11:25p Feodoric says, "each sector is labelled with the name of a gemstone, according to its position in the sphere."
3/26/25 6:11:27p (Wayfarer grins)
3/26/25 6:11:27p Feodoric says, "This is a good point to actually look at the chart, so I'll confer with my clan mates for a moment"

3/26/25 6:11:27p (Harper's eyes widen.)
3/26/25 6:11:29p Harper asks, "The 9 spheres are organized around the central sphere?"
3/26/25 6:11:29p Feodoric says, "That's correct"
3/26/25 6:11:30p Melben asks, "8 are yes?"
3/26/25 6:11:30p Melben says, "so 1 then 1 for each side of octagon"
3/26/25 6:11:31p Feodoric says, "Yes, 2-9 are group around the first"
3/26/25 6:11:31p Harper says, "ah ... that's what I meant, aye"

3/26/25 6:11:58p Feodoric exclaims, "Follow that link!"
3/26/25 6:11:59p (Harper looks at her map in fascination)
3/26/25 6:12:00p Harper says, "this must have been incredibly difficult to figure out"
3/26/25 6:12:00p Borzon ponders, "as I said, sudoku :)"
3/26/25 6:12:00p Feodoric ponders, "http://h3o.ca/d/maps/BasicEPMap.html"
3/26/25 6:12:01p Gloria exclaims, "Oh perfect timing!"
3/26/25 6:12:02p Emer ponders, " "

3/26/25 6:12:03p Feodoric says, "Diamond, Sapphire and Emerald,"
3/26/25 6:12:03p (CmdrGuard listens some more)
3/26/25 6:12:04p IHael'du asks, "gates?"
3/26/25 6:12:04p Feodoric says, "and Onyx, Opal and Topaz."
3/26/25 6:12:05p Feodoric says, "Those are the names of the sectors"
3/26/25 6:12:05p Feodoric says, "They're always in that configuration in every sphere."
3/26/25 6:12:06p (Harper gazes at the drawing with profound respect for the explorers that figured this out)
3/26/25 6:12:07p Melben ponders, "I see"
3/26/25 6:12:07p Feodoric says, "Don't worry, if you don't remember this..."
3/26/25 6:12:08p Feodoric says, "You won't fall into a tear in reality or anything."
3/26/25 6:12:08p (Wayfarer raises a flipper)

3/26/25 6:12:09p Phiros ponders, "you might.."
3/26/25 6:12:09p Sunblaze asks, "Gems?"
3/26/25 6:12:10p Feodoric says, "No, generally a properly trained mystic is needed to figure out which sector you're in"
3/26/25 6:12:10p You have 32 coins.
3/26/25 6:12:11p Feodoric says, "Unless there's a handy landmark."
3/26/25 6:12:11p (Harper looks up)
3/26/25 6:12:12p Feodoric asks, "Wayfarer?"
3/26/25 6:12:14p Wayfarer asks, "are the snell crossing between sectors normal, or marshlike, or something else?"
3/26/25 6:12:14p Melben ponders, "the actual gems grow in power within those snells, I would assume"
3/26/25 6:12:15p Feodoric says, "I was about to get to the snell crossings"
3/26/25 6:12:15p (Wayfarer nods)
3/26/25 6:12:15p Feodoric says, "They're not marshlike, but they're not quite normal either."
3/26/25 6:12:15p (Melben clutches her ruby necklace.)
3/26/25 6:12:17p Feodoric says, "Before I get to that, one useful thing to note is that the center sector of every sphere...."
3/26/25 6:12:17p Feodoric says, "is Sapphire."
3/26/25 6:12:18p Feodoric says, "That's where the interesting things tend to be."

3/26/25 6:12:20p Feodoric says, "Sometimes shiny."
3/26/25 6:12:21p Feodoric says, "Sometimes of the giant, eat-your-face-off variety."
3/26/25 6:12:21p (CmdrGuard listens some more)
3/26/25 6:12:21p Feodoric says, "It varies."
3/26/25 6:12:22p Lily Fren ponders, "But I like my face."
3/26/25 6:12:23p Feodoric says, "Now: how to navigate within spheres."
3/26/25 6:12:23p (Sunblaze wonders why mammals used gems and other stuff for naming stuff. *snickers*)
3/26/25 6:12:26p Wayfarer ponders, "I suppose we could have named them after dragons"
3/26/25 6:12:26p Feodoric says, "Going in one direction will take you to the next sector in that direction"
3/26/25 6:12:27p Feodoric says, "So, normal snell crossings, usually."

3/26/25 6:12:28p Wayfarer ponders, "aha!"
3/26/25 6:12:29p Feodoric says, "In fact,"
3/26/25 6:12:29p Harper asks, "Do you know you've done that?"
3/26/25 6:12:29p Feodoric says, "Without an ethereal amulet you will be trapped within whichever sphere you start in."
3/26/25 6:12:30p IHael'du asks, "Leave someone in the last snell and keep walking?"
3/26/25 6:12:30p Feodoric says, "You won't know it's happened unless you're keeping careful track of where you are."
3/26/25 6:12:30p CmdrGuard ponders, "Periodic boundary conditions... how mario 2 like..."
3/26/25 6:12:31p Feodoric says, "Hello folks."
3/26/25 6:12:31p Daimoth says, "Hello"
3/26/25 6:12:31p (Wayfarer fingers his etheral amulet, wishing he knew how to use it)
3/26/25 6:12:32p Gloria exclaims, "I have a question!"
3/26/25 6:12:32p Feodoric asks, "Gloria?"
3/26/25 6:12:33p Borzon ponders, "finally, someone I can't one-shot"
3/26/25 6:12:34p Wayfarer ponders, "or ten-shot"
3/26/25 6:12:34p Fiona ponders, "Back-up has arrived"
3/26/25 6:12:34p Gloria asks, "When you say trapped, does that mean that you can't move between EP regions, or can you get back to Puddleby?"
3/26/25 6:12:36p Feodoric says, "I mean you can't move between EP regions"
3/26/25 6:12:36p You have 32 coins.

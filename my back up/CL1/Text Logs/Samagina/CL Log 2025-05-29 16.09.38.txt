5/29/25 5:17:25p Salandra says, "As far as I know, mystics were supposed to mostly, "play with other mystics," in a social manner."
5/29/25 5:17:48p Silky says, "but I'm sure there are still people who are happy to have a mystic friend with them on every hunt even if the contribution on the hunt phases are low"
5/29/25 5:17:53p Samagina says, "but never worked out"

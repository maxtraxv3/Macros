1/25/25 5:55:17p Ramandu says, "Well, not really. I guess I got used to it"
1/25/25 5:55:20p Shadowfire says, "xD"
1/25/25 5:55:28p Ramandu says, "Because this "you have 1 swing" nonsense with MB is killing me :p"
1/25/25 5:55:29p Omega thinks, "Ω"
1/25/25 5:55:29p Omega thinks, "Ω"
1/25/25 5:55:55p Shadowfire ponders, "337 more Evus until the great swap of 2025"

1/25/25 5:56:10p Shadowfire says, "Yeah rangers are usually one swing wonders"
1/25/25 5:56:46p Ramandu says, "I dunno if it was you or Ona, but someone said I should probably have about twice as much Swengus as I do, given my other ranks"
1/25/25 5:56:59p Ramandu says, "I guess I just trained to tag stuff"
1/25/25 5:57:09p Shadowfire says, "Well you pretty much have to at the start"
1/25/25 5:57:18p Ramandu says, "Or maybe I just never thought about my training seriously"

1/25/25 5:57:51p (Aurelie hums softly.)
1/25/25 5:58:00p Shadowfire says, "Eh well it's ok, you can get away with it"
1/25/25 5:58:09p Shadowfire says, "I would not suggest trying that as a champion though"
1/25/25 5:58:12p (Ramandu grins)
1/25/25 5:58:30p Ramandu says, "That's why my main strategy is, and will remain, to hide behind you :p"

1/25/25 6:00:23p Aurelie says, "I kinda adore you all."
1/25/25 6:00:24p Ramandu says, "So don't do that unless you have a goofy sense of humor like me"
1/25/25 6:00:25p Ramandu exclaims, "Good night!"
1/25/25 6:00:28p Ramandu says, "Books are good"

1/25/25 6:01:53p Shadowfire says, "The biggest starting mistake is buying/salvaging a slow ship you can't afford to supply"
1/25/25 6:02:01p Ramandu says, "So at least I won't be struggling for supplies for a bit"
1/25/25 6:02:08p Ramandu says, "Uh..... yeah I think I did that"
1/25/25 6:02:09p Shadowfire says, "Try to use burn 9+ ships at first so you can run away if you need to"
1/25/25 6:02:20p Shadowfire says, "One other thing that will really help"
1/25/25 6:02:20p Ramandu asks, "burn 9?"
1/25/25 6:02:30p Ramandu asks, "That's a speed rating?"
1/25/25 6:02:33p Shadowfire says, "Keep an eye out for pirate oxes"
1/25/25 6:02:37p Shadowfire says, "Yeah campaign layer"

1/25/25 6:02:42p Shadowfire says, "not oxes"
1/25/25 6:02:46p Shadowfire says, "Buffalo (P)"
1/25/25 6:02:49p Ramandu says, "heh"
1/25/25 6:03:03p Ramandu says, "Ah"
1/25/25 6:03:06p Ramandu says, "Maximum Burn, you mean"
1/25/25 6:03:10p Shadowfire says, "Having ships with phase field in your fleet will reduce your sensor profile"
1/25/25 6:03:26p Shadowfire says, "Which makes it easier to do smuggling and hide when bad things chase you"
1/25/25 6:03:49p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:04:01p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:04:09p Ramandu says, "I think right now I really just need to focus on the absolute most baby-simple strategy stuff"
1/25/25 6:04:14p (Shadowfire nods)
1/25/25 6:04:27p Shadowfire says, "Buffalo (P) is the best starting point"
1/25/25 6:04:28p Ramandu says, "Like apparently you want more flux dissipation than weapon flux"
1/25/25 6:04:34p Shadowfire says, "Ideally yes"
1/25/25 6:04:40p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Bard concert at 11am Pacific on Jan. 25th. Entries for Azriels' contest will be played, so come enjoy the new music!"
1/25/25 6:04:41p Ramandu says, "Cool, I'll try to get one"
1/25/25 6:04:42p Shadowfire says, "Advanced Gunnery Control helps with that"
1/25/25 6:05:01p Shadowfire says, "Because you can set it up so that your ships aren't blasting away with everything 100% of the time"
1/25/25 6:05:09p Shadowfire says, "So you can have say, 750 flux dissipation"
1/25/25 6:05:15p Shadowfire says, "And 1400 weapon flux total"
1/25/25 6:05:22p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:05:27p Shadowfire says, "But set it up so the ship is only firing 700 at any given time"
1/25/25 6:05:43p Shadowfire says, "Basically max vents is the starting point"
1/25/25 6:05:58p Shadowfire says, "Only do less if you have a plan and know what you're doing"
1/25/25 6:05:58p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:06:05p Ramandu says, "I don't and I don't"
1/25/25 6:06:12p Shadowfire says, "Is ok, it takes some time"
1/25/25 6:06:29p Shadowfire says, "Also don't be afraid to just hit the autopilot and be the ships active venting AI"
1/25/25 6:06:42p Shadowfire says, "AI is super, SUPER reluctant to vent"

1/25/25 6:06:44p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:06:58p Shadowfire says, "So even just you looking at the situation and choosing when to force it to vent can be really good"
1/25/25 6:07:28p Shadowfire says, "Also if you're early on and using small ships"
1/25/25 6:07:42p Shadowfire says, "Try to get faster (speed 120+"
1/25/25 6:07:45p Shadowfire says, "frigates"
1/25/25 6:08:02p You have 2678 coins.

1/25/25 6:08:36p Ramandu says, "Hmm."
1/25/25 6:08:38p Shadowfire says, "Oh also there's some QoL stuff that does things like aim assist and automatic shield control"
1/25/25 6:08:53p Shadowfire says, "So all you have to do is fly and choose when to fire missiles"
1/25/25 6:08:56p Ramandu asks, "Actually, can I ask you a outfitting question?"
1/25/25 6:08:59p Shadowfire says, "Sure"
1/25/25 6:09:10p Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
1/25/25 6:09:11p Ramandu says, "I've assembled this terrible fleet of medium size ships"
1/25/25 6:09:18p Shadowfire says, "Can be as specific as you like, I know all the ships and weapons"
1/25/25 6:09:19p Ramandu says, "But I have it, so there."

1/25/25 6:10:00p Ramandu says, "And in the front I'm trying to decide whether to put on Pulse Lasers or IR Pulse Lasers"
1/25/25 6:10:13p Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
1/25/25 6:10:16p Ramandu says, "The Pulse Lasers use more ordinace points so I'd assume they're better..."
1/25/25 6:10:21p Ramandu says, "but the also use way more flux"

1/25/25 6:11:13p Shadowfire says, "When you're first starting out the best simple heuristic is to look at flux efficiency"
1/25/25 6:11:27p Shadowfire says, "i.e. DPS : FPS ratio"
1/25/25 6:11:52p Shadowfire says, "So for a sunder"
1/25/25 6:12:03p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:12:05p Ramandu asks, "half the dps for less than half the fps seems better in that situation?"
1/25/25 6:12:06p Crius yells, "It’s 3 o’clock, and all’s well."
1/25/25 6:12:10p Shadowfire says, "Midline, so usually ok to bad shields but good flux stats"
1/25/25 6:12:10p Crius yells, "It looks pretty quiet in the Eastern Mountains."
1/25/25 6:12:20p Shadowfire says, "In the sunder's case it has a good shield"
1/25/25 6:12:23p Shadowfire says, "But also really bad armor"
1/25/25 6:12:35p Shadowfire says, "And the ship system (High Energy Focus)"
1/25/25 6:12:54p Shadowfire says, "Mean that sunders are generally best used to hit and run"
1/25/25 6:13:13p EBow is now Clanning.
1/25/25 6:13:13p Shadowfire says, "In the case of a hit and run ship, you'd usually want the higher DPS"

1/25/25 6:13:53p Arianrhod is now Clanning.
1/25/25 6:13:59p Ramandu says, "Hmm"
1/25/25 6:14:02p Shadowfire says, "Also this is not immediately obvious"
1/25/25 6:14:15p Shadowfire says, "But for example pulse laser hits for 100"
1/25/25 6:14:18p Shadowfire says, "IR pulse hits for 50"
1/25/25 6:14:30p Shadowfire says, "This means that pulse laser is significantly better vs armor"
1/25/25 6:14:39p Ramandu asks, "Oh?"
1/25/25 6:14:43p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:14:44p Shadowfire says, "Basically armor works like this"
1/25/25 6:14:52p Ramandu asks, "Armor reduces a flat amount rather than a percentage?"
1/25/25 6:15:02p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Bard concert at 11am Pacific on Jan. 25th. Entries for Azriels' contest will be played, so come enjoy the new music!"
1/25/25 6:15:17p Shadowfire says, "ActualDamage = damage * (damage / (damage+armor))"
1/25/25 6:15:34p Shadowfire says, "So it gets reduced based on how much armor there is"
1/25/25 6:15:58p Shadowfire says, "So on something like a dominator or an onslaught, they have big armor, so a pulse laser will struggle to scratch them"
1/25/25 6:16:03p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:16:16p Shadowfire says, "You'll eventually chip away enough of it to do damage, but might die before you get there"
1/25/25 6:16:32p Shadowfire says, "This also means that IR pulse lasers are really terrible vs low tech ships generally"
1/25/25 6:16:44p Shadowfire says, "because of the low hit strength"
1/25/25 6:16:59p Shadowfire says, "high energy focus helps this by increasing damage without increasing flux"
1/25/25 6:17:14p Shadowfire says, "So basically you want to use HEF right as you start fiting"
1/25/25 6:17:15p Shadowfire says, "So basically you want to use HEF right as you start firing"
1/25/25 6:17:23p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:17:29p Shadowfire says, "Then back off once it wears off or you have too much flux built up"
1/25/25 6:17:51p Shadowfire says, "Try to start backing off at ~75-80% flux unless you have a compelling reason not to"
1/25/25 6:18:14p Shadowfire says, "Because the enemy will volley fire missiles, usually harpoons at you if you let your flux get too high"
1/25/25 6:18:27p Shadowfire says, "And those will absolutely shred a sunder"
1/25/25 6:18:40p Ramandu says, "hmm"
1/25/25 6:18:44p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:18:55p Ramandu says, "Sounds like I basically need to try, make a bunch of mistakes, and hopefully learn from them"
1/25/25 6:18:55p Shadowfire says, "Ideally pick yourself up a large energy weapon on a black market and use that as your main dps"
1/25/25 6:19:13p Shadowfire says, "And use the medium mounts as a supplement"
1/25/25 6:19:57p Shadowfire says, "can use ion beams/graviton beam/IR autolance/mining blaster"
1/25/25 6:19:59p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:20:04p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:20:08p Shadowfire says, "ion beam to punish lowering shields"
1/25/25 6:20:13p Koppi yells, "Jeepers reports: Tell me, where is Crunch? For I much desire to speak with him."
1/25/25 6:20:19p Shadowfire says, "graviton beam as low flux shield damage amplifiers"
1/25/25 6:20:32p Shadowfire says, "IR autolance to punish lowering shields when you have stipped armor"
1/25/25 6:20:45p Shadowfire says, "mining blaster to shred armor after your main weapon has fluxed them out"
1/25/25 6:21:08p Shadowfire says, "Autpulse is a good choice for sunder"
1/25/25 6:21:24p You have 2678 coins.

1/25/25 6:21:47p Shadowfire says, "HIL is harder to use because it does HE damage so is bad vs shields"
1/25/25 6:22:05p Shadowfire says, "So it's more for a support build where your other ships win the flux war for you, then you strike the killing blow"
1/25/25 6:22:19p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:22:25p Shadowfire says, "Tachyon lance is similar, though they can shred frigates/destroyers with HEF"
1/25/25 6:22:44p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:22:53p Shadowfire says, "plasma cannon is a great weapon but a destroyer's flux core isn't really going to be enough to let you keep up the pressure"
1/25/25 6:23:12p Shadowfire says, "The great thing about tachlance"
1/25/25 6:23:32p Shadowfire says, "Is that if your target is high flux, it can cause shield piercing damage and EMP arcs"
1/25/25 6:23:52p Shadowfire says, "So even if their shields are up you can still do damage and disable their engines/weapons/etc."
1/25/25 6:24:04p You have 2678 coins.
1/25/25 6:24:07p (Ramandu nods)
1/25/25 6:24:22p Shadowfire says, "Kind of expensive though"
1/25/25 6:24:44p Ramandu says, "I'm still not sure I can afford supplies and fuel and stuff :p"
1/25/25 6:24:47p Shadowfire says, "But in general I'd say if you don't have a large"
1/25/25 6:25:09p Shadowfire says, "go with 2x pulse lasers and do HEF burst -> back off and vent"

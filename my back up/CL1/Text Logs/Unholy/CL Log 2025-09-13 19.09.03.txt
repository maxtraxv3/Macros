9/13/25 8:33:24p Silky says, "and use 100% of your balance"
9/13/25 8:33:32p Catan says, "oh ok"
9/13/25 8:34:02p Silky says, "but if you dont need to hit 1180 , say just 1000 then your balance usage is just 88%"
9/13/25 8:34:06p Catan says, "So I do this once I have stored the 30 duin ranks I need to sutdy and get that bonus you re taling me about"

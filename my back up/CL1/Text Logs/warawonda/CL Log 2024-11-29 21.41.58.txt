Dunno if they're going to add it or if they even want to. (Healer pets is the example I refer to that healers got for the same purpose.)"

11/29/24 11:21:28p Salandra thinks to you, "Well, I dunno that the issue is who needs attention more or who is around more and would gain more benefits. I think whether or not it happens is a matter of breaking away from the y2k vision of mystics as social entities who rely on community involvement/social interactions for their fun."

11/29/24 11:24:11p You think to Salandra, "i mean i agree with that sentiment or they should lean more into alts, I.E. bring back the follow command more ablity to bot, but i rather it be more in line of your way of thinking"
11/29/24 11:24:26p Salandra thinks to you, "As for what it looks like, that's harder. Some kinda of avatar/pet system could work, some kind of "city management" thing with NPCs/quests could work. What works or doesn't work really kinda depends on how willing they are to expand what is "ok for a mystic to be able to do.""

11/29/24 11:25:59p Salandra thinks to you, "The new skills and areas do a much better job of supporting mystics (and I don't have any real complaints about them), but those areas and skills are not things that could possibly be used for 90% of the day."

11/29/24 11:27:33p Salandra thinks to you, "If we had 100+ people online 24/7 then I don't think my arguement has merit. It's just that we don't. And we have very very very few people who actively play mystics as their main character."

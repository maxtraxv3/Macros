12/15/24 5:34:17a Sativa says, "it wasn't to be rude, she is just too funny for her own good"
12/15/24 5:34:27a You have 13679 coins.
12/15/24 5:34:29a Pe Ell says, "But yes we heard something about you looking for a heart of ice... ranting about it, really..."
12/15/24 5:34:34a Phroon says, "That's one way to warm up"
12/15/24 5:34:37a Garr hands a glass of Glorak's Bawkmas brew to Kasarra.
12/15/24 5:34:38a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:34:42a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:34:45a Kasarra asks, "Really?"
12/15/24 5:34:47a Kasarra asks, "Hearing from who?"
12/15/24 5:34:54a (Ausrine looks warmer.)
12/15/24 5:34:56a Kasarra says, "Kasarra am not remembering having this conversation with anyone."
12/15/24 5:35:00a Pe Ell asks, "... uh... friends of yours?"
12/15/24 5:35:00a Seaforth says, "From your sister."
12/15/24 5:35:00a Warawonda says, "n-no one"
12/15/24 5:35:11a Kasarra ponders, "Lasarra…"
12/15/24 5:35:13a (Kasarra grunts.)
12/15/24 5:35:14a Ravenstorm asks, "the fix is in?"
12/15/24 5:35:16a Seaforth says, "Lasarra."
12/15/24 5:35:20a Kasarra says, "We will have words with our fists later."
12/15/24 5:35:21a Garr says, "One of your sisters mentioned that you talk in your sleep or something"
12/15/24 5:35:22a (Inu Teisei): and so Seaforth ratted Lasara out
12/15/24 5:35:29a Garr says, "Or mumble"
12/15/24 5:35:30a (Garr shrugs)
12/15/24 5:35:33a Elenis Reyav says, "Ah, yes. The good old fistwords."

12/15/24 5:36:10a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:36:12a The Wanderer ponders, "I knew this was a good spot :P"
12/15/24 5:36:14a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:36:15a Elenis Reyav asks, "The heart of ice? Or a heart of ice?"
12/15/24 5:36:19a Dare is no longer Clanning.
12/15/24 5:36:20a Garr asks, "There's a big hole in the mountain. Maybe it's down there?"
12/15/24 5:36:29a Phroon asks, "Big hole?"
12/15/24 5:36:30a (Elenis Reyav nods toward Garr.)
12/15/24 5:36:31a Kasarra says, "It is colder than usual here, but Kasarra has been reading old texts that suggest it am being under this mountain."
12/15/24 5:36:32a Pe Ell says, "And what makes it a heart? Unless it's carved that way."
12/15/24 5:36:41a Seaforth says, "Reading? Really."
12/15/24 5:36:41a Omega asks, "BLue Mountain Hole?"
12/15/24 5:36:45a Kasarra says, "Kasarra has not seen it, but."
12/15/24 5:36:47a Ravenstorm says, "sweet"
12/15/24 5:36:50a Elenis Reyav says, "Makes sense. You usually shouldn't wear your heart on the outside."
12/15/24 5:36:51a Kasarra says, "This ice am cold enough to withstand even the smith's fire."
12/15/24 5:36:57a Ravenstorm asks, "do you know where the entry is?"
12/15/24 5:36:58a Kasarra says, "So legend am saying."
12/15/24 5:37:02a Pe Ell says, "Hmmm"
12/15/24 5:37:08a You have 13679 coins.
12/15/24 5:37:13a Kevas ponders, "Hmm. Is it safe to handle if it is that cold?"
12/15/24 5:37:17a Garr asks, "Is it strong enough to withstand the pants of power though?"
12/15/24 5:37:26a (Garr looks at Seaforth with confidence)
12/15/24 5:37:29a Seaforth ponders, "probably"
12/15/24 5:37:34a * Your mental enhancement fades.
12/15/24 5:37:35a Kasarra exclaims, "Ice in pants? Ha! Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:37:40a Seaforth exclaims, "ha!"
12/15/24 5:37:43a Elenis Reyav says, "Only one way to find out, Garr."
12/15/24 5:37:43a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:37:44a Kasarra exclaims, "Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:37:44a Pe Ell ponders, "Should throw it in the DI volcano and solve two problems at once"
12/15/24 5:37:47a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:38:02a Elenis Reyav says, "Beware you don't end up with a trio of frozen lumps."
12/15/24 5:38:12a Seaforth says, "And you are seeking the ice at the heart of the mountain."
12/15/24 5:38:12a * You notice something on Kasarra's feet.
12/15/24 5:38:20a Kasarra says, "Yes."
12/15/24 5:38:21a Seaforth says, "For your forge."
12/15/24 5:38:26a (Kasarra grunts assent.)
12/15/24 5:38:28a You have 13679 coins.
12/15/24 5:38:29a Sativa says, "wait a moment"
12/15/24 5:38:42a Sativa asks, "what are those shoes about?"
12/15/24 5:38:45a (Valadorei notices something on Kasarra's feet.)
12/15/24 5:38:50a Sativa exclaims, "they look distinguished!"
12/15/24 5:39:00a Ausrine says, "they look heavy."
12/15/24 5:39:01a Seaforth says, "Perhaps we could help you find it."
12/15/24 5:39:04a Kasarra is a Ghorak Zo, is female, is a smith, and is not wearing the symbol of any clan.
12/15/24 5:39:04a She is holding a tinder box and a wooden shield, and she is wearing a sunstone and a lead boots.
12/15/24 5:39:04a (is wearing a tattoo)

12/15/24 5:39:14a Warawonda ponders, "lead boots"
12/15/24 5:39:15a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:39:16a Kasarra says, "If you gain any information, Kasarra am very interested."
12/15/24 5:39:18a Nug ponders, "zo mafia trying to give us a pair of lead boots"
12/15/24 5:39:19a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:39:22a Kasarra says, "Maybe very useful for forging silksteel."
12/15/24 5:39:28a Garr ponders, "My shoes were always making me run off to places. Maybe lead boots would keep me in one spot."
12/15/24 5:39:30a Elenis Reyav says, "Sounds like a mutually beneficial relationship."
12/15/24 5:39:31a Sativa says, "where I come from, shoes are made of metal and very heavy"
12/15/24 5:39:32a Seaforth exclaims, "Silksteel!"
12/15/24 5:39:42a (The Wanderer's eyes perk up again at the mention of silk)
12/15/24 5:39:43a Kasarra says, "Heavy shoes? You would like these."
12/15/24 5:39:45a The Wanderer shows his skein of silk to everyone.
12/15/24 5:39:48a You have 13679 coins.
12/15/24 5:39:49a Kasarra says, "They am VERY heavy. Not that Kasarra notices."
12/15/24 5:39:49a (Warawonda nods)
12/15/24 5:39:54a Seaforth asks, "This ice is not for use in lead boots?"
12/15/24 5:39:55a Kasarra says, "Kasarra was not resting here."
12/15/24 5:40:03a Kasarra says, "Kasarra was not fatigued from climbing a mountain in lead boots."
12/15/24 5:40:09a Elenis Reyav asks, "Why are you only wearing one lead boots?"
12/15/24 5:40:12a (Warawonda nods)
12/15/24 5:40:22a Kasarra says, "Because no one else am having lead boots, silly human."
12/15/24 5:40:30a Kasarra says, "No one else has Kasarra's wisdom and mastery of craft."
12/15/24 5:40:32a (Dandelion hides a grin)
12/15/24 5:40:34a Seaforth asks, "Kasarra, why would someone want boots of lead?"
12/15/24 5:40:44a Kasarra says, "Kasarra was wondering that same question when last we spoke."
12/15/24 5:40:45a Elenis Reyav says, "I'm certainly a silly human, but I don't mind."
12/15/24 5:40:47a Warawonda ponders, "i want lead boots"
12/15/24 5:40:47a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:40:50a Seaforth asks, "Don't they fill the people full of dread?"
12/15/24 5:40:51a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:40:57a Elenis Reyav says, "It gets others to loose up."
12/15/24 5:40:57a Kasarra exclaims, "Oh, you are rhyming human! Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:41:02a Garr says, "We should hire Kasarra. Powean isn't nearly as good of a smith"
12/15/24 5:41:05a The Wanderer says, "+Defense from RainbowRadiation Dmg."
12/15/24 5:41:06a Seaforth exclaims, "Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:41:08a You have 13679 coins.
12/15/24 5:41:10a Kasarra exclaims, "Ha! Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:41:16a (Kasarra whispers loudly.)
12/15/24 5:41:17a Seaforth exclaims, "Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
12/15/24 5:41:19a (Ausrine sticks her hands near the embers.)
12/15/24 5:41:29a Warawonda ponders, "bad"
12/15/24 5:41:33a Coriakin ponders, "Lead? Dread? Did we actually send LA to negotiate instead?"
12/15/24 5:41:36a Kasarra says, "Actually, they am not seeming very useful to Kasarra. But they am providing some protection from stubbing Kasarra's toes on rocks and halflings."
12/15/24 5:41:52a (Aurelie giggles.)
12/15/24 5:41:54a The Wanderer ponders, "or perhaps any kind of shadow/aoe damaging effects perhaps.."
12/15/24 5:41:56a Garr says, "Halflings do seem to get in the way"
12/15/24 5:42:08a Sativa says, "Gotta say Kasarra, you look pretty cool, and might look cooler in a sweet blacksmith workshop"
12/15/24 5:42:09a Seaforth says, "Perhaps some of us could try lead boots, to see if they have further use."
12/15/24 5:42:09a Warawonda ponders, "heh"
12/15/24 5:42:19a (Kasarra grunts.)
12/15/24 5:42:20a The slope seems pretty steep.
12/15/24 5:42:24a Sativa says, "in Puddlby"
12/15/24 5:42:24a Hopping down that ledge looks like a one-way trip.
12/15/24 5:42:27a Kasarra asks, "You am bringing more litharge?"

12/15/24 5:42:53a Garr says, "I have a couple"
12/15/24 5:42:56a Katreesa asks, "hmm, we usually get more xp for these things, don't we?"
12/15/24 5:43:00a Seaforth says, "We could use a better smith in Puddleby. I, personally, would very much like to have you around more."
12/15/24 5:43:00a Kasarra says, "Yes. Two should be enough."
12/15/24 5:43:10a Garr says, "More back in Puddleby if you need them though"
12/15/24 5:43:12a Kasarra asks, "Personally?"
12/15/24 5:43:16a (Seaforth smiles)
12/15/24 5:43:22a The Wanderer ponders, "at least 10 heaping helpings of xp. it is known."
12/15/24 5:43:26a Kasarra ponders, "He's a bit underfed for my tastes."
12/15/24 5:43:30a (Seaforth flexes his biceps)
12/15/24 5:43:40a Katreesa says, "haven't really noticed any"
12/15/24 5:43:44a (Kasarra shrugs.)

12/15/24 5:44:31a (Garr nods at Raven)
12/15/24 5:44:32a Kasarra says, "Oh, Fountfell may not be big enough for the three of us."
12/15/24 5:44:40a Kasarra says, "But Kasarra was thinking of maybe throwing her off that mountain."
12/15/24 5:44:40a Kenzen is now Clanning.
12/15/24 5:44:45a (Garr grins)

12/15/24 5:45:45a Kasarra raises her glass of Glorak's Bawkmas brew on high, and drains it in one gulp.
12/15/24 5:45:48a (Garr cheers)

12/15/24 5:46:16a (Kasarra suddenly understands why Ausrine is stamping out fires.)

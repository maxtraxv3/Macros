12/22/24 5:43:28a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:43:35a Glastonboony says, "If I may say so, the couture of your group is nonpareil."
12/22/24 5:43:46a Warawonda asks, "?"
12/22/24 5:43:47a Sativa says, "that is a delicious treat also"
12/22/24 5:43:53a Elenis Reyav growls, "That comes from having many forms."
12/22/24 5:43:55a Shadowfire says, "Strewth"
12/22/24 5:43:55a Cecil says, "I wonder if there is a new path somewhere else in silversang we missed"
12/22/24 5:43:59a Balangar exclaims, "yes, we sew it !"
12/22/24 5:44:02a Ausrine says, "its very cold and your cloaks are warm."
12/22/24 5:44:02a Nug says, "oh"
12/22/24 5:44:02a (Bessie smile)
12/22/24 5:44:06a Nug asks, "is this the heart of ice?"
12/22/24 5:44:07a Kevas ponders, "We dress like confectionaries?"
12/22/24 5:44:27a Glastonboony says, "Hearts of Ice, yes. A Windspinner I know spoke of such a thing, deep beneath this mountain."
12/22/24 5:44:28a Katreesa says, ":)"
12/22/24 5:44:35a Balangar says, "there was no needle to speak about cloth"
12/22/24 5:44:40a Elenis Reyav asks, "Do you have any advice for how we might reach it?"
12/22/24 5:44:42a Glastonboony looks behind himself towards the chasm.
12/22/24 5:44:48a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:44:53a (Elenis Reyav glances in the same direction as Glastonboony.)
12/22/24 5:45:02a Glastonboony says, "Such things should be regarded as little more than rumor or legend, and yet…"
12/22/24 5:45:07a Naferu ponders, "please be a skijump"
12/22/24 5:45:07a Seaforth asks, "Glastonboony, how many mystics must we sacrifice to the mountain?"
12/22/24 5:45:18a Salandra says, "When we came here before, we felt a great darkness from this pit."
12/22/24 5:45:22a Glastonboony asks, "What interest is there beyond fashion if we do not chase at rumors, hoping to become something greater?"
12/22/24 5:45:27a Seaforth asks, "A dozen? Many dozens?"
12/22/24 5:45:30a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
12/22/24 5:45:34a (Phroon smiles)
12/22/24 5:45:35a Coriakin ponders, "Ah, hot chocolate when it's snowing out. Delightful."
12/22/24 5:45:35a Katreesa says, "so happy with the newly fitted cloak"
12/22/24 5:45:35a (Elenis Reyav agrees, enthusiastically.)
12/22/24 5:45:37a Glastonboony says, "Greetings, Sativa."
12/22/24 5:45:38a Glastonboony adjusts his cloak, gathering his thoughts.
12/22/24 5:45:39a Pe Ell ponders, "What I'm hearing is that we need a giant ice drill"
12/22/24 5:45:43a Nug ponders, "is there a greater calling than fashion?"
12/22/24 5:45:44a Sativa says, "I'm not opposed to a suicide mission"
12/22/24 5:45:51a Katreesa says, ":)"
12/22/24 5:45:53a Elenis Reyav says, "Chasing legend is how one becomes legend themselves."
12/22/24 5:45:56a (Shadowfire smiles)
12/22/24 5:46:01a Warawonda ponders, "he looks north?"
12/22/24 5:46:05a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Or abject failure, but lets focus on the positives."
12/22/24 5:46:09a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:46:14a Glastonboony says, "The cliffs are slick with ice and near sheer."
12/22/24 5:46:17a (Salandra slips a map from her pack)
12/22/24 5:46:18a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
12/22/24 5:46:21a Sativa says, "eek"
12/22/24 5:46:33a Sativa says, "and our thoomish skin can stick to ice real bad"
12/22/24 5:46:37a Phroon ponders, "Rope technology"
12/22/24 5:46:40a Elenis Reyav says, "Maybe if we could melt the edges to be more.. irregular.."
12/22/24 5:46:46a Ausrine says, "There's an energy in this place as well."
12/22/24 5:46:46a Glastonboony asks, "For me, I'm more interested in the wisdom of this cave. What purpose did this site hold to those who came before?"
12/22/24 5:46:49a Kalian says, "spikes for the lead boots"
12/22/24 5:46:53a (Ausrine nods)
12/22/24 5:46:58a Ausrine ponders, "brrrrrr"
12/22/24 5:47:01a (Elenis Reyav contemplates.)
12/22/24 5:47:02a Glastonboony asks, "Does it relate to your so-called Heart of Ice?"
12/22/24 5:47:09a Onashi ponders, "we'll need lead crampons for our lead boots"
12/22/24 5:47:17a Bessie asks in Ghorak Zo, "Glastonboony know crumbly ice?"
12/22/24 5:47:18a Seaforth asks, "Would it help if we had really unnecessarilly heavy boots?"
12/22/24 5:47:21a Ausrine says, "It... might."
12/22/24 5:47:25a Glastonboony says, "I'm hoping we can clear the ice and take a closer look at the runes."
12/22/24 5:47:29a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:47:34a Glastonboony looks at Lord Seaforth.
12/22/24 5:47:34a Ausrine asks, "Any advice on clearing the ice?"
12/22/24 5:47:43a Naferu ponders, "lead crampons would dull quickly..."
12/22/24 5:47:46a Kevas ponders, "All of the ice? That's a lot."
12/22/24 5:47:47a Shadowfire asks, "Lead krampons?"
12/22/24 5:47:47a (Seaforth smiles winningly)
12/22/24 5:47:47a Glastonboony asks, "Do you think they'd aid in your traction somehow?"
12/22/24 5:47:48a (Sativa nods)
12/22/24 5:47:56a Seaforth exclaims, "I believe they might!"
12/22/24 5:48:07a Glastonboony ponders, "What a smile! He could charm a glacier."
12/22/24 5:48:09a Seaforth says, "They drawn one to the earth"
12/22/24 5:48:19a Naferu ponders, "i would prefer a sled"
12/22/24 5:48:20a Sativa asks, "got any tips for puttin hard sharp things on the big shoes?"
12/22/24 5:48:32a Shadowfire says, "Hmm, I guess lead boots could be much more easily shaped with earth magic"
12/22/24 5:48:35a Glastonboony says, "If one's only goal was to fall down and survival were not a consideration, I'm sure they'd hasten your descent."
12/22/24 5:48:44a (Phroon grins)
12/22/24 5:48:44a Seaforth exclaims, "As if the earth and lead boots were lovers!"
12/22/24 5:48:47a (Sativa nods)
12/22/24 5:48:49a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:48:49a Shadowfire says, "So we could just turn them into crampons when needed and resharpen as needed"
12/22/24 5:48:53a Pe Ell says, "We've never been very concerned about our own survival"
12/22/24 5:48:56a Glastonboony says, "A doomed romance, but a good story."
12/22/24 5:49:02a Elenis Reyav asks, "Might magical firewater help clear a path?"
12/22/24 5:49:06a Sativa says, "earth. thats that stuff Champions talk about"
12/22/24 5:49:07a Naferu growls, "nothing a good 'ol spelunking can't get past"
12/22/24 5:49:08a Elenis Reyav juggles his bottle of fire water from one hand to the other.
12/22/24 5:49:09a Coriakin says, "Oh, I like those"
12/22/24 5:49:12a Glastonboony asks, "Firewater?"
12/22/24 5:49:18a Seaforth says, "We do talk of the Earth"
12/22/24 5:49:19a Glastonboony gulps.
12/22/24 5:49:24a Salandra says, "Very near to here, there is the Orga emcampment we refer to as Hippy Hollow. The Orga are known to gather at places of power.."
12/22/24 5:49:29a Elenis Reyav says, "The Orga use it in their catapults to explosive effect."
12/22/24 5:49:38a Elenis Reyav says, "It burns incredibly hotly."
12/22/24 5:49:43a Bessie says in Ghorak Zo, "water that burns"
12/22/24 5:49:45a Glastonboony peers at the cave ceiling above him, riddled with fractures and wider openings.
12/22/24 5:49:51a Coriakin says, "I'm not sure explosives underground are a great idea...."
12/22/24 5:49:51a Phroon says, "Might be too hot and too fast"
12/22/24 5:49:54a Glastonboony asks, "…may … be?"
12/22/24 5:50:09a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:50:17a Elenis Reyav says, "Maybe so, merely trying to find ways we might help with the tools we have. ^_^"
12/22/24 5:50:18a (Sativa tries to throw a handful of ice up to the ceiling)
12/22/24 5:50:18a Salandra says, "It may bot be stable enough for fires or explosions"
12/22/24 5:50:18a Naferu takes a small foil-wrapped coin from his bag of chocolate coins and gobbles it down in two bites.
12/22/24 5:50:34a Glastonboony looks enviously at Naferu's treats.
12/22/24 5:50:41a (Naferu holds out the bag)
12/22/24 5:50:42a Inu Teisei thinks, "yay! Blow things up!!"
12/22/24 5:50:42a (Eirian Caldwell chuckles.)
12/22/24 5:50:45a Naferu shows his bag of chocolate coins to everyone.
12/22/24 5:50:54a Naferu picks up a bag of chocolate coins.
12/22/24 5:50:58a You equip your cigar.
12/22/24 5:51:01a Glastonboony says, "I don't know how to get down there any better than you do, but I'm interested in learning more about this heart of ice."
12/22/24 5:51:04a Elenis Reyav says, "Perhaps with enough rope or chains we could lower ourselves down."
12/22/24 5:51:11a Naferu picks up a bag of chocolate coins.
12/22/24 5:51:11a You slip your cigar into your backpack.
12/22/24 5:51:11a Sativa says, "me too"
12/22/24 5:51:13a Glastonboony says, "And especially in getting to those runes."
12/22/24 5:51:26a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
12/22/24 5:51:29a Seaforth plants a seedling.
12/22/24 5:51:29a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:51:30a Glastonboony exclaims, "I thought my name would be published in one of those Windspinner libraries!"
12/22/24 5:51:43a Seaforth says, "hmm"
12/22/24 5:51:45a Pe Ell says, "Step one: Throw the mystics down. Step two: Use their bodies as a cushion for the rest of our jumps."
12/22/24 5:51:48a Naferu says, "i guess they wan't to be over there"
12/22/24 5:51:52a Naferu says, "i guess they want to be over there"
12/22/24 5:51:54a * Your mental enhancement fades.
12/22/24 5:51:54a You show your moon manual to everyone.
12/22/24 5:52:01a (Elenis Reyav smiles.)
12/22/24 5:52:05a Seaforth asks, "Could we climb down a wall of vines?"
12/22/24 5:52:07a Ravenstorm says, "Step one..we can have lots of fun"
12/22/24 5:52:21a Glastonboony looks speculatively at Lord Seaforth.
12/22/24 5:52:22a Hashak shows his parachute to everyone.
12/22/24 5:52:27a Hashak asks, "Should I jump down?"
12/22/24 5:52:30a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Hashak has the way!"
12/22/24 5:52:30a Salandra says, "Perhaps it is in the Stormlyric monastery. We've not yet been able to visit them there."
12/22/24 5:52:32a Naferu picks up a bag of chocolate coins.
12/22/24 5:52:36a Glastonboony says, "Parachutes, vines. These all seem like capital ideas."
12/22/24 5:52:44a Coriakin asks, "Maybe we come back with logs and tinderboxes and try to heat the ice?"
12/22/24 5:52:46a Eirian Caldwell asks, "where is that one?"
12/22/24 5:52:50a You have 12868 coins.
12/22/24 5:52:51a Glastonboony says, "A bit less risky to the old structural integrity of the place than the earlier idea with the explosives."
12/22/24 5:52:54a Hashak says, "I'm ready"

12/22/24 5:57:35a Glastonboony exclaims, "But truth be told I am a hobbyist. My friends think of me as a mere tailor!"

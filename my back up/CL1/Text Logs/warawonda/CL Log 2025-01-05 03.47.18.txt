1/5/25 4:50:17a Krrait growls, "Most interesting. Such a token does not trivially change hands."
1/5/25 4:50:40a Ausrine says, "Well Endrondus' seems like he's not especially competent so I'm not surprised he lost it."
1/5/25 4:50:45a Biro says, "i'm sure the entire process was diplomatic and nonviolent, like we puddlebeans tend to solve our problems"

1/5/25 4:51:26a (Inu Teisei): Praise ConeBeast!
1/5/25 4:51:28a Krrait growls, "I could take the ankh, but that seems too easy."
1/5/25 4:51:29a Shadowfire says, "No threat intended, it's just that we're industry leading specialists in murder and sometimes get enthusiastic."
1/5/25 4:51:29a Palmeri says, "Mt Dew fire child"

1/5/25 4:53:18a Elenis Reyav asks, "Is your cute appearance a ploy then to get others to underestimate you?"

1/5/25 4:53:56a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
1/5/25 4:54:01a Krrait growls, "For Greater Deaths, these ones are a bit below average."
1/5/25 4:54:01a Palmeri says, "so Krrait you obviously want something to help us, just ask for it"
1/5/25 4:54:15a Ausrine asks, "So if you're not going to take this Ankh what do you suggest?"
1/5/25 4:54:23a Krrait growls, "That? No, then I'd be stuck with it."
1/5/25 4:54:28a Seaforth says, "ow"
1/5/25 4:54:29a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar looks out at the world around it.
1/5/25 4:54:32a Valadorei ponders, "He kind of looks like a blind amphibian standing up."
1/5/25 4:54:37a Sycamore asks, "Perhaps there is a way to destroy it?"
1/5/25 4:54:49a You have 2684 coins.

1/5/25 4:54:52a Palmeri ponders, "omg he DOES! like an axolotyl"
1/5/25 4:54:57a Shadowfire ponders, "Ankh or what?"
1/5/25 4:55:00a Inu Teisei ponders, "i nwonder if it can be dropped into this abyss"
1/5/25 4:55:04a Sycamore asks, "involving long journeys with short people, volcanoes full of lava, that sort of thing?"
1/5/25 4:55:04a Inu Teisei ponders, "i wonder if it can be dropped into this abyss"
1/5/25 4:55:16a Palmeri asks, "Or Krrait... can we curse someone else with it for you?"
1/5/25 4:55:21a Krrait growls, "If you seek to be rid of it, the fastest path might be to gift it to the same friends who delivered it."
1/5/25 4:55:33a Garr asks, "Well if the Master is out, does that mean he's in the caverns underneath Ash Island?"
1/5/25 4:55:34a Kevas ponders, "What would that do to them?"
1/5/25 4:55:34a Krrait growls, "They seem to possess an unusual ability to not be bound thusly."
1/5/25 4:55:38a Krrait growls, "On the other hand..."
1/5/25 4:55:44a Warawonda ponders, "are there female pirates?"
1/5/25 4:55:47a (Inu Teisei): regift, secret santa? darn it just passed
1/5/25 4:55:50a (Krrait waves a hand to silence Garr.)
1/5/25 4:55:50a Shadowfire says, "Indeed so"
1/5/25 4:55:50a Biro ponders, "but what if the ankh isn't cursed, and it's all a misunderstanding?"
1/5/25 4:55:53a Seaforth asks, "What, are we going to just offer to do chores for a demon?"
1/5/25 4:56:02a (Garr grumbles)
1/5/25 4:56:09a Pe Ell exclaims, "If the chores are killing, then maybe, Seaforth!"
1/5/25 4:56:09a You have 2684 coins.
1/5/25 4:56:12a Garr exclaims, "Hey that hurt!"

1/5/25 4:56:20a Seaforth says, "We do that for free."
1/5/25 4:56:24a Ausrine asks, "on the other hand...?"
1/5/25 4:56:28a Pe Ell says, "Shhh don't let him know that"
1/5/25 4:56:37a Krrait growls, "Endrondus…yes."
1/5/25 4:56:44a Krrait growls, "Without the ankh he may have less protection of his own."
1/5/25 4:56:57a Seaforth says, "I have a question. Is Kthorax a demon or a devil? THis is important to know."
1/5/25 4:57:03a Krrait ponders, "Once the master finds out."
1/5/25 4:57:10a Garr asks, "Does that mean the Ankh is protection against your master and it's minions?"
1/5/25 4:57:13a Ausrine asks, "Would that protection transfer to me?"
1/5/25 4:57:24a Krrait growls, "The ankh was a contractual obligation."
1/5/25 4:57:29a You have 2684 coins.
1/5/25 4:57:34a Krrait growls, "You do not appear to be written into the terms of the contract."
1/5/25 4:57:38a Kevas asks, "A contract for what, between whom?"
1/5/25 4:57:42a Warawonda asks, "will K'thaaxotroxz weaken the one who made the deal?"
1/5/25 4:57:50a Krrait growls, "The deal may be forfeit."
1/5/25 4:57:53a Inu Teisei ponders, "this sounds like the other contract with spriggins and their pranks"
1/5/25 4:57:54a Ausrine asks, "What was the contract?"
1/5/25 4:57:54a Pe Ell ponders, "If he's a deal-maker, definitely a devil"
1/5/25 4:57:58a Ausrine asks, "What were the terms?"
1/5/25 4:58:01a Krrait growls, "We will have to review the fine print."
1/5/25 4:58:10a (Inu Teisei): it's always in the fine print
1/5/25 4:58:28a (Inu Teisei): was it an LA™ Brand Contract?
1/5/25 4:58:30a Krrait growls, "I am not at liberty to divulge the details, but let us say "for services rendered.""
1/5/25 4:58:41a Ausrine says, "huh."
1/5/25 4:58:43a Krrait growls, "May I go?"
1/5/25 4:58:47a Inu Teisei says, "no"
1/5/25 4:58:50a You have 2684 coins.
1/5/25 4:58:52a (Krrait fidgets.)
1/5/25 4:59:01a Krrait growls, "I had an important appointment."
1/5/25 4:59:01a Giben turns to stone.
1/5/25 4:59:01a Ausrine asks, "Endrondus is keeping your master in our realm, right?"
1/5/25 4:59:05a Palmeri yells, "what, gotta get back to your master"
1/5/25 4:59:11a Krrait growls, "I was going to get my horns waxed."
1/5/25 4:59:20a Biro says, "I have this ancient, magical artifact that contains the soul of festive gnomes (maybe)"
1/5/25 4:59:22a Ausrine says, "I can tell you need it."
1/5/25 4:59:25a Biro shows her candy club to Krrait.
1/5/25 4:59:25a Seaforth says, "I am willing to have my attorney (Lion-O) look at the contract."
1/5/25 4:59:37a Krrait growls, "Mmm, gnomes."
1/5/25 4:59:48a Krrait ponders, "Minty!"
1/5/25 4:59:51a Sycamore exclaims, "they're tasty! Taste like meeshra!"
1/5/25 4:59:54a (Biro nods!)
1/5/25 4:59:55a (Phroon chuckles.)
1/5/25 4:59:56a Elenis Reyav says, "You've got excellent taste given the color of your flames, Krrait."
1/5/25 5:00:08a Palmeri asks, "Ausrine, do you have what you need from this trickster?"
1/5/25 5:00:10a You have 2684 coins.
1/5/25 5:00:13a Warawonda asks, "perhaps we can help each other with this broken contract?"
1/5/25 5:00:15a Krrait growls, "They'd be nicer if they were a darker, more foresty green with deep shadows behind them."
1/5/25 5:00:22a Krrait growls, "If you know the sort of color I mean."
1/5/25 5:00:26a Eirian Caldwell exclaims, "that would be nice!"
1/5/25 5:00:31a (Elenis Reyav tries to keep from looking too hurt.)
1/5/25 5:00:31a Ausrine says, "We learned more about the origin of the Ankh and its purpose."
1/5/25 5:00:32a Seaforth says, "British Racing Green"
1/5/25 5:00:38a (Elenis Reyav fails.)
1/5/25 5:00:41a Ausrine says, "I don't think I want to try and make any deals with this thing."
1/5/25 5:00:49a Ausrine says, "With it's hairy... horns."
1/5/25 5:00:50a (Eirian Caldwell pats Elenis comfortingly)
1/5/25 5:00:52a (Krrait has a piece of parchment ready for Elenis Reyav to sign his name on.)
1/5/25 5:00:53a Palmeri asks, "Do you know where to guide us next? do we need that from him?"
1/5/25 5:00:56a (Inu Teisei): we need cap'n for contracts
1/5/25 5:01:01a (Sycamore wonders what Elenix would do to reclaim his cloak)
1/5/25 5:01:12a Elenis Reyav says, "I'd need a few mystics to review the contract for me."
1/5/25 5:01:16a Ausrine says, "I think we should look around Ash more. Maybe try and get into the mines there."
1/5/25 5:01:22a (Palmeri nods)
1/5/25 5:01:23a Elenis Reyav says, "I haven't brushed up on my demonology in a while."
1/5/25 5:01:24a Palmeri says, "Krrait"

1/5/25 5:01:42a (Krrait squirms.)
1/5/25 5:01:43a Biro ponders, "unless Krrait wants to teach us, how to travel deeper into the abyssal plane :D"
1/5/25 5:01:48a Krrait growls, "I don't have a gender."
1/5/25 5:01:48a Ravenstorm says, "hehe"
1/5/25 5:01:52a Palmeri exclaims, "no for me!"
1/5/25 5:01:58a Palmeri says, "I was a gorgeous sylvan woman"
1/5/25 5:01:59a Krrait growls, "Oh, that, yeah. Easy."

1/5/25 5:03:39a Garr asks, "So shall we get rid of this thing and see if we can find it's master in the mines?"

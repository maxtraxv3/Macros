1/19/25 6:38:37a Inu Teisei ponders, "i wonder if it's through SC that the Shadow Plane learned music?"
1/19/25 6:38:43a (Sylune rests her eyes for a moment)
1/19/25 6:39:04a Xepel says, "... you definitely played some, Coriakin"

1/19/25 6:39:53a Xepel says, "But _my_ harp isn't already tinged with madness"
1/19/25 6:39:54a Sativa says, "womp womp"
1/19/25 6:39:57a Coriakin ponders, "I can't remember..."
1/19/25 6:39:57a Inu Teisei says, "So they learnt from AP as well"

1/19/25 6:40:23a (Valadorei blushes lightly.)
1/19/25 6:40:24a Inu Teisei says, "You do have that song that sings the praises of the SP"
1/19/25 6:40:27a Xepel says, "See, all... well, it's not spotless, I don't polish it enough, but it's not shadowy"
1/19/25 6:40:36a (Aurelie smiles at Val.)
1/19/25 6:40:38a Inu Teisei says, "Aqua Poofs"
1/19/25 6:40:40a Coriakin asks, "Shouldn't I be mentoring someone learning to write music?"
1/19/25 6:40:52a Inu Teisei says, "what is that song"
1/19/25 6:40:54a Xepel says, "That song is... purely... uh... for laughs, Inu"

1/19/25 6:42:04a (Coriakin claps)

1/19/25 6:42:22a Xepel says, "I think we were trying to get there maybe? It's hard to say"
1/19/25 6:42:26a Coriakin says, "But yes, if anyone happens to venture back to the shadowplane, keep an eye out for Chaconne, please"
1/19/25 6:42:38a (Aurelie shivers a bit.)
1/19/25 6:42:39a Inu Teisei says, "poor chacone"
1/19/25 6:42:39a Coriakin says, "I'm still hoping she's fine, even though it's been some time."
1/19/25 6:42:44a Xepel says, "Right, frostweir"
1/19/25 6:42:47a (Valadorei covers a yawn.)
1/19/25 6:42:51a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers something you can't quite hear.
1/19/25 6:42:56a Thistle says, "Oh, no"
1/19/25 6:42:57a (Aurelie give Val a lil nudge.)
1/19/25 6:42:58a Coriakin says, "Oh Xepel, your turn to play something."
1/19/25 6:43:00a Sativa exclaims, "thanks for the fun times! gonna read a lil!"
1/19/25 6:43:03a (Inu Teisei waves)

3/2/25 4:40:09a Elenis Reyav says, "Some people wear their feelings on their shoulder. Cecil wears it on his head."
3/2/25 4:40:13a Kalian says, "since Sativa kinda locked the cloud out from moving anytime soon"
3/2/25 4:40:23a Sativa asks, "oh that's how it works?"
3/2/25 4:40:24a Inu Teisei thinks, "1. chipped, 2. cracked. 3.?"
3/2/25 4:40:28a Kordal says, "So... we move a purple/green portal for a bit, then move to a mirror that presumably needs some kind of key, go to a cloudd, move it over here, drop on this place, and currently wait for the rest of the group."
3/2/25 4:40:32a Sativa says, "woops"

3/2/25 4:41:01a Sativa says, "hmm"
3/2/25 4:41:04a Elenis Reyav asks, "Can we do anything with mystics and tethering to get others here?"
3/2/25 4:41:10a Elenis Reyav says, "I hear that's a thing."
3/2/25 4:41:19a Asenath says, "full charge wins over partials mostly, I can fill purtple side"
3/2/25 4:41:23a Sativa exclaims, "I will gladly volunteer for a suicide mission!"
3/2/25 4:41:26a Inu Teisei thinks, "1. chipped, 2. cracked. 3.fractured 4. splintered 5. ?"

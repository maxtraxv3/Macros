3/16/25 3:16:04a Aye'Cha thinks, "If catan falls, I'm in TC and can go after him."
3/16/25 3:16:09a Coriakin says, "Sounds good to me, Garr."

3/16/25 4:35:32a Lugubrion says, "In any case, you'll know we've succeed if the portal closes"
3/16/25 4:35:34a Inu Teisei asks, "can we mine them?"
3/16/25 4:35:35a Warawonda asks, "is there awya to stablise this place instead of removing it?"
3/16/25 4:35:42a Inu Teisei says, "for um"
3/16/25 4:35:45a (Aurelie gently takes out a small gitor masterfully carved with the image of a large, autumnal tree.)
3/16/25 4:35:46a Inu Teisei asks, "science?"
3/16/25 4:35:51a Aurelie starts playing her gitor.
3/16/25 4:35:51a (Aurelie): Turning Pages
3/16/25 4:35:52a Coriakin says, "Noivad, that sounds like untying a knot with a cannon"
3/16/25 4:36:01a Seaforth says, "Autumnal tree, best kind of tree."
3/16/25 4:36:08a Lugubrion says, "The only way this place can become stable is by reducing the ethereal buildup"
3/16/25 4:36:09a Pe Ell says, "Couldn't we stablize the portal instead? We could always use more stable portals..."
3/16/25 4:36:10a Noivad asks, "theknot disappears wouldn't it?"
3/16/25 4:36:18a (Pe Ell hmms)
3/16/25 4:36:29a Lugubrion says, "This could be a site for a properly constructed kyuem in the future"
3/16/25 4:36:32a You have 21452 coins.
3/16/25 4:36:35a Seaforth says, "We need an ethereal sand blaster."
3/16/25 4:36:36a Ekusai is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:36:37a Coriakin says, "Noivad, I'd prefer the island not have another gaping hole in it, like the one west of the keep"
3/16/25 4:36:39a Inu Teisei says, "that's acceptable"
3/16/25 4:36:49a A map of Puddleby town is overdrawn with battle plans.
3/16/25 4:36:52a Inu Teisei says, "new portal, check"
3/16/25 4:36:55a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
3/16/25 4:36:55a The battle plans are overdrawn with some kind waxy purple pigment.
3/16/25 4:37:07a Lugubrion says, "This is only the first step in stabilizing the plane as a whole."
3/16/25 4:37:08a Coriakin says, "Something to look forward to in the future, perhaps"
3/16/25 4:37:12a Lugubrion says, "aas sighs."
3/16/25 4:37:14a (Lugubrion sighs.)
3/16/25 4:37:14a (Inu Teisei): A new portal with built in filters to reject invaders from the other side
3/16/25 4:37:24a Warawonda asks, "is there away to do that?"
3/16/25 4:37:26a Lov'sya incants in a mystical language.
3/16/25 4:37:28a Coriakin says, "First steps are still steps."
3/16/25 4:37:32a (Phroon nods.)
3/16/25 4:37:36a (Inu Teisei jumps way ahead)
3/16/25 4:37:38a Pe Ell ponders, "If we're going to have an ethereal disaster, lets have it on DI and sink the whole thing."
3/16/25 4:37:41a Kevas says in Thoom, "All journeys start somewhere."
3/16/25 4:37:41a Garr says, "There are quite a few odd anomalies inside the plane, it would be nice to stable them"
3/16/25 4:37:48a Lugubrion says, "I spoke with several of you at my keep about means of stabilizing the plane."
3/16/25 4:37:51a (Dandelion nods)
3/16/25 4:37:51a Bessie says in Ghorak Zo, "zo simple take power thing stop"
3/16/25 4:37:51a Biro ponders, "the first step only took us 25 years. we'll get the ether under control in no time!"
3/16/25 4:37:53a (Coriakin nods)
3/16/25 4:37:56a Noivad starts playing his starbuck harp.
3/16/25 4:37:57a (Noivad): The End
3/16/25 4:37:58a Lugubrion says, "I still have my doubts about whether it is possible"
3/16/25 4:38:06a (Aurelie beams at Noivad!)
3/16/25 4:38:08a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar winks at you.
3/16/25 4:38:18a Lugubrion says, "It will likely require more kyuems, and initiating a process of crystallization"
3/16/25 4:38:26a (Inu Teisei scans Cori for fun and giggles)
3/16/25 4:38:32a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers something you can't quite hear.
3/16/25 4:38:32a Dandelion says, "Dat last bit sounds pretty, at least"
3/16/25 4:38:35a Coriakin says, "Perhaps it's the reckless optimist in me, but I prefer to at least try"
3/16/25 4:38:43a (Phroon nods.)
3/16/25 4:38:46a Ausrine asks, "while we're clearing here, and collecting the materials for new kyeums, what will you be doing to assist us?"
3/16/25 4:38:48a Haffron ponders, "whatever happened to the Kyuem at Lugubrion's castle..."
3/16/25 4:38:49a Sativa says, "What are the implications of a stable ether I wonder"
3/16/25 4:38:57a Coriakin says, "Plus, I know a few exiles who would be eager to find a safer way to use kyuems"
3/16/25 4:38:57a Garr asks, "By placing additional Kyuems inside the plane itself will help stabilize it?"
3/16/25 4:38:59a Warawonda asks, "is there places we need to have them build for this to work?"
3/16/25 4:39:04a Inu Teisei ponders, "sit here and weep, I suspect"
3/16/25 4:39:13a Seaforth says, "I will volunteer the efforts of my most expendable retainers."
3/16/25 4:39:21a Lugubrion says, "Your scholars are trained in finding suitable places for kyuems."
3/16/25 4:39:29a (Garr nods)
3/16/25 4:39:29a (Phroon nods)
3/16/25 4:39:32a Manquilor says, "Oh I wouldn't go that far..."
3/16/25 4:39:33a (Valadorei nods)
3/16/25 4:39:34a (Sativa mourns for Seaforth's croooked teeth)
3/16/25 4:39:38a Lugubrion says, "They are not trained in crystallizing ether, however."
3/16/25 4:39:41a Garr says, "I did not realize they could find places with in the ethereal plane"
3/16/25 4:39:46a Akorz is no longer Clanning.

3/16/25 4:39:55a Lov'sya incants in lore.
3/16/25 4:39:56a Garr asks, "I thought the flow of Ether towards the Annulus was too distracting?"
3/16/25 4:39:58a You have 21452 coins.
3/16/25 4:39:59a Seaforth says, "Crystal ether..."
3/16/25 4:40:00a Warawonda asks, "where can we learn this?"
3/16/25 4:40:01a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
3/16/25 4:40:01a Inu Teisei ponders, "I wonder what happens if you Crystalize Ether while SC is around"
3/16/25 4:40:02a Garr says, "Maybe I was mistaken though"
3/16/25 4:40:06a Coriakin ponders, "harp?"
3/16/25 4:40:07a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar squirms in and out of the fabric of reality.
3/16/25 4:40:12a Lugubrion says, "There is one Sarir who was researching this ability"
3/16/25 4:40:17a • You hear Coriakin's music...
3/16/25 4:40:17a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
3/16/25 4:40:18a (Coriakin): "Sunlight Through The Shadows"
3/16/25 4:40:21a Lugubrion says, "They are currently in Sombrion's employ"
3/16/25 4:40:29a (Warawonda nods)
3/16/25 4:40:33a (Inu Teisei jumps ahead again, plotting)
3/16/25 4:40:38a Lov'sya incants in a mystical language.
3/16/25 4:40:38a Katreesa ponders, "need caffeine be back"
3/16/25 4:40:42a Sativa asks, "does this Sarir have a name?"
3/16/25 4:40:47a Phroon says, "Ah. I think that was Aledral."
3/16/25 4:40:49a (Lov'sya pulls up on his collar a bit.)
3/16/25 4:40:52a Dandelion exclaims, "Ally!"
3/16/25 4:40:54a Coriakin says, "I'm glad Aledral was able to find meaningful emply"
3/16/25 4:40:56a Coriakin says, "I'm glad Aledral was able to find meaningful employ"
3/16/25 4:40:57a Lugubrion says, "Aledral, yes."
3/16/25 4:41:00a (Sativa smiles)
3/16/25 4:41:03a (Manquilor smiles.)
3/16/25 4:41:05a Coriakin says, "Very distraught when we first met 'em, I remember"
3/16/25 4:41:09a Inu Teisei asks, "What does he need in addition to Ethercle?"
3/16/25 4:41:31a Inu Teisei ponders, "flowers?"
3/16/25 4:41:36a Lugubrion says, "Is is not easy to get one of Sombrion's servants to help us, however."
3/16/25 4:41:45a (Phroon nods…)
3/16/25 4:41:45a Sawyer is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:41:57a Lugubrion says, "Sombrion will certainly not do anything if I am the one to ask."
3/16/25 4:41:59a Dandelion exclaims, "No crashers inna clubhouse!"
3/16/25 4:42:02a Seaforth ponders, "allo-hedral?"
3/16/25 4:42:19a Coriakin says, "I think there are exiles working on establishing a rapport of some kind"
3/16/25 4:42:20a Lugubrion says, "But he may listen to Cimmbrion."
3/16/25 4:42:23a Inu Teisei ponders, "We figured that"
3/16/25 4:42:25a Bingro is no longer Clanning.
3/16/25 4:42:29a Coriakin asks, "Oh, really?"
3/16/25 4:42:29a (Valadorei nods.)
3/16/25 4:42:32a Lugubrion says, "And he may listen to some of you."
3/16/25 4:42:32a Kalian says, "He might listen to me but I'm not a mystic"
3/16/25 4:42:35a Garr asks, "Kalian currently has some favor with your brother I think as well?"
3/16/25 4:42:37a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar attempts to pass among the exiles.
3/16/25 4:42:40a (Aurelie smiles fondly at the thought of Lord Cimmbrion.)
3/16/25 4:42:44a Kalian says, "He gave me this"
3/16/25 4:42:46a Kalian juggles his Imperial chain mail vest from one hand to the other.
3/16/25 4:42:50a Inu Teisei ponders, "only some, the nerve!"
3/16/25 4:42:51a Coriakin says, "Two avenues to investigate, then"
3/16/25 4:43:08a Garr says, "Perhaps the two of them together could do it"
3/16/25 4:43:11a Slyph is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:43:21a Lugubrion says, "Well then, if some of you are receiving rewards from Sombrion, that shows he does favor you to some degree"
3/16/25 4:43:23a (Biro blinks)
3/16/25 4:43:25a You have 21452 coins.
3/16/25 4:43:41a (Ausrine frowns.)

3/16/25 4:44:22a Aurelie says, "Alder, too."
3/16/25 4:44:25a Cojrax is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:44:36a Sativa asks, "Mind if I ask why stabilizing the ether benefits you Lord Lugubrion?"
3/16/25 4:44:42a Valadorei says, "Cimmbrion seems to keep peace with most of you brothers."
3/16/25 4:44:53a Garr says, "We also should probably ask Cimmbrion if he can help fix the scarring of the earth here now that we've mostly driven the Darshak out"
3/16/25 4:44:56a Lugubrion says, "I ask myself the same thing sometimes, Sativa."
3/16/25 4:45:02a (Sativa nods)
3/16/25 4:45:04a Biro ponders, "not every wizard desires a ticking time bomb plane"
3/16/25 4:45:17a Sativa says, "ehh everything explodes eventually"
3/16/25 4:45:18a Lugubrion asks, "Do I really care about the material plane escaping its inevitable destruction?"
3/16/25 4:45:21a Pe Ell says, "..."
3/16/25 4:45:26a (Phroon nods…)
3/16/25 4:45:31a Daimoth ponders, "Hopefully"
3/16/25 4:45:36a Lugubrion says, "Lately I've been thinking..."
3/16/25 4:45:38a Inu Teisei ponders, "you would get bored sticking to EP"
3/16/25 4:45:42a (Phroon worries.)
3/16/25 4:45:42a Warawonda asks, "hmm?"
3/16/25 4:45:42a Valadorei ponders, "How morose..."
3/16/25 4:45:47a Noivad says, "well his beachfront property would drop in value"
3/16/25 4:45:50a Lugubrion says, "That the material plane has the best music, and the best bodies of water."
3/16/25 4:45:51a Ausrine says, "always dangerous for a wizard."
3/16/25 4:45:54a Biro ponders, "I don't think you'd be able to recreate that giant instrument, in the Geharza"
3/16/25 4:45:54a Garr ponders, "Maybe he's just lost sight of the mission his father gave him"
3/16/25 4:46:00a Aurelie exclaims, "Best music indeed!"
3/16/25 4:46:03a Pe Ell says, "Not a lot of water in the ether, very true"
3/16/25 4:46:03a Lugubrion says, "So for now I think I'd prefer for us all to stay in existence."
3/16/25 4:46:05a (Seaforth): E.E.E. Everything Explodes Eventually.
3/16/25 4:46:06a Aurelie asks, "Oh wait...is it my turn again?"
3/16/25 4:46:19a Sativa says, "you make a convincing cae Lugubrion"
3/16/25 4:46:21a (Aurelie plays something reminescent of home.)
3/16/25 4:46:23a Noivad says, "plus the keep's resale value would be affected"
3/16/25 4:46:27a Aurelie starts playing her violène.
3/16/25 4:46:27a (Aurelie): The Myrkil'shin: Movement III - Children's Song
3/16/25 4:46:41a Garr asks, "How goes the renovations of your keep? Has the thoom started yet?"
3/16/25 4:46:42a Lugubrion says, "Also I'm learning to play the violene"
3/16/25 4:46:46a (Coriakin smiles)
3/16/25 4:46:52a You have 21452 coins.
3/16/25 4:46:56a Garr ponders, "Lazy Thooms"
3/16/25 4:46:58a Coriakin says, "I was going to ask about that when all this was finished"
3/16/25 4:46:59a Lugubrion says, "Renovations? Oh, I knew I was forgetting something"
3/16/25 4:47:00a Noivad says, "^D"
3/16/25 4:47:04a Noivad says, "^D"
3/16/25 4:47:07a Warawonda says, ":)"
3/16/25 4:47:13a Biro asks, "was the instrument named after the spider? or the other way around?"
3/16/25 4:47:19a Coriakin says, "How are things going with the violene? I hope it's brought you some joy"
3/16/25 4:47:25a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar murmurs about the dangers of ducks.
3/16/25 4:47:28a Coriakin says, "Or at least entertainment"
3/16/25 4:47:40a Warawonda asks, "hows the renovations going?"
3/16/25 4:47:44a (Inu Teisei spreads Shadow Energy to cheer up Luggy)
3/16/25 4:47:48a Lugubrion says, "I'm having to get used to being able to play only a few notes at a time..."
3/16/25 4:47:58a (Dandelion mutters something about refuting entropy)
3/16/25 4:47:58a Mero is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:48:00a (Noivad claps)

3/16/25 4:48:06a (Coriakin smiles)
3/16/25 4:48:09a Lugubrion says, "Last I checked, the thooms had found their way down to the zodiac maze..."
3/16/25 4:48:14a Noivad says, "no worse than this"
3/16/25 4:48:16a Coriakin says, "It's certainly different."
3/16/25 4:48:18a You equip your pine flute.
3/16/25 4:48:19a Lugubrion says, "It's in a bad state."
3/16/25 4:48:21a Homeless is now Clanning.
3/16/25 4:48:22a Garr asks, "Oh?"
3/16/25 4:48:23a • You lack the skill to play this musical instrument.
3/16/25 4:48:26a Garr says, "Hmm"
3/16/25 4:48:27a Seaforth asks, "Why not turn entropy into WIN-tropy?"
3/16/25 4:48:27a You slip your pine flute into your backpack.
3/16/25 4:48:34a Garr says, "I bet we could help clear it out"
3/16/25 4:48:44a Nisa is now Clanning.

3/16/25 4:49:07a Warawonda asks, "could we help with the renvations?"

3/16/25 4:49:57a (Aurelie smiles fondly at this song.)
3/16/25 4:50:07a Garr says, "I've been giving him everything I can find, but the lazy puddlebeans want a fountain or some nonsense"
3/16/25 4:50:19a Coriakin says, "Well, I'm looking forward to seeing what it'll look like when it's finished"
3/16/25 4:50:20a Lugubrion says, "A fountain? That's not something I can rightly object to"

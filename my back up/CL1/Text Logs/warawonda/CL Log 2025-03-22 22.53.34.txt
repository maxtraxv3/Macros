3/23/25 4:35:53a Sedum says, "Abbess Andrachnea sent me to study the unusual properties of this cavern."
3/23/25 4:35:53a Katreesa says, "oh snap"
3/23/25 4:35:54a Cecil says, "we all float down here"
3/23/25 4:35:54a Ausrine asks, "for what purpose?"
3/23/25 4:35:55a Sedum says, "The hydrological systems associated with glaciers often create and destroy ice caves, season to season and epoch to epoch."
3/23/25 4:35:57a Sedum says, "…yet the overall structure of this cave has a surprising tenacity."
3/23/25 4:35:57a Sedum ponders, "Mataline guide my steps."
3/23/25 4:36:00a Naferu ponders, "rocket boots"
3/23/25 4:36:04a (Sativa lands on his face at the edge)

3/23/25 4:36:09a (Pun'isher sobs)
3/23/25 4:36:10a Saxifrage says, "But the wind began to fail as we attempted to go lower."
3/23/25 4:36:18a Garr says, "Maybe you need some lead boots to make you heavier"
3/23/25 4:36:21a Pun'isher growls, "how...how cud they?!"
3/23/25 4:36:24a Sativa says, "hmm"
3/23/25 4:36:32a Omega ponders, "very hmmmm"

3/23/25 4:36:38a Phroon says, "I think Falling isn't the hard part, Garr"
3/23/25 4:36:38a Saxifrage says, "We have been seeking other ways down."
3/23/25 4:36:41a Clemence asks, "do we get parachutes?"
3/23/25 4:36:43a Naferu yells, "k'tower"
3/23/25 4:36:48a Saxifrage says, "A hidden stair. We've lowered ladders and carried lanterns."
3/23/25 4:36:50a Hashak shows his parachute to Clemence.
3/23/25 4:36:51a Kalian says, "We've got access to parachutes"
3/23/25 4:36:57a Hashak ponders, "needs a tailor"
3/23/25 4:37:02a Maisy is no longer Clanning.
3/23/25 4:37:02a (Saxifrage nods.)
3/23/25 4:37:18a Saxifrage says, "An excellent idea."
3/23/25 4:37:23a Naferu growls, "oooh"
3/23/25 4:37:30a Inu Teisei says, "i see vines"
3/23/25 4:37:33a Inu Teisei says, "or i did"
3/23/25 4:37:37a Pun'isher growls, "i have a parachute"

3/23/25 4:37:58a Sativa says, "I wanna float on wind tho"
3/23/25 4:37:59a Inu Teisei asks, "anyone else try to crowbar the edges?"
3/23/25 4:38:03a Sativa says, "that's way cooler"
3/23/25 4:38:06a Naferu growls, "can wa make a chain of exiles and climb down?"
3/23/25 4:38:06a Hashak says, "I'll catch you"
3/23/25 4:38:10a Saxifrage says, "Perhaps my colleague Sedum would be willing to volunteer."
3/23/25 4:38:17a Omega says, ")"

3/23/25 4:38:33a (Clemence looks at Sedum)
3/23/25 4:38:33a Hashak exclaims, "ambush!"
3/23/25 4:38:53a Cecil says, "worth it"
3/23/25 4:38:55a Pun'isher growls, "it needs repair"
3/23/25 4:39:24a Pun'isher growls, "should i try to give the parachute to sexi?"
3/23/25 4:39:31a (Seaforth attempts to insert an airhose in Bulgatra, experimentally)
3/23/25 4:39:35a Clemence says, "go for it"
3/23/25 4:39:37a Saxifrage asks, "Do you have an extra that you might let us borrow?"
3/23/25 4:39:42a Saxifrage says, "It did not occur to us to bring them here."
3/23/25 4:39:43a Sativa asks, "extra what?"
3/23/25 4:39:44a Seaforth ponders, "hmm"
3/23/25 4:39:50a You show your parachute to everyone.
3/23/25 4:40:04a Sativa says, "people always say I am a little exxtra"

3/23/25 4:40:15a Kordal has fallen to a Tamazaja.
3/23/25 4:40:20a Garr asks, "It can't be deeper than a fall from the cloud can it?"
3/23/25 4:40:22a Kordal is no longer fallen.
3/23/25 4:40:30a (Phroon hrms.)
3/23/25 4:40:41a Sativa says, "looks safe here for the moment"
3/23/25 4:40:43a Warawonda ponders, "cloud can be on ground level"
3/23/25 4:40:44a Pe Ell growls, "Well, parachutes also need to have enough room to open. So it also can't be too shallow."
3/23/25 4:40:58a Saxifrage says, "There seems little danger of it being too shallow."
3/23/25 4:40:59a Ausrine says, "wow thanks Pe Ell"
3/23/25 4:41:00a Pun'isher asks, "should i try to sell it to sexi?"

3/23/25 4:41:37a Saxifrage ponders, "I hope it is more than a crypt down there."
3/23/25 4:41:39a Garr says, "that was supposed to be a push hehe"
3/23/25 4:41:39a Sativa says, "I dont mind being inflated"

3/23/25 4:42:51a Warawonda ponders, "i bet is chaos"
3/23/25 4:42:56a Katreesa says, "maybe these new cloaks can act like a squirrel suit"
3/23/25 4:42:57a Naferu growls, "can we pour water from bottles and make a slide or staircase?"
3/23/25 4:42:58a Pun'isher says, "prolly lint cause this looks like a giant belly button"

3/23/25 4:43:17a Warawonda ponders, "oooh knowage"
3/23/25 4:43:23a Kevas ponders, "It's probably doom. It's usually doom."
3/23/25 4:43:28a Saxifrage says, "But much of what was known is lost, as is sadly too often the case."
3/23/25 4:43:34a Sativa says, "doom leads to treasure and definitely not the other way around"
3/23/25 4:43:35a (Aurelie nods.)
3/23/25 4:43:36a Garr says, "If the writings are to be understood. The heart of ice might be what did this to all these creatures"

3/23/25 4:45:41a Garr asks, "When did we last make a wise decision Cori?"
3/23/25 4:45:45a Seaforth says, "Delving has never been a mistake, Cori."
3/23/25 4:45:46a Saxifrage says, "It is the Windspinner creed to share the light of knowledge."
3/23/25 4:45:51a Kevas ponders, "Nothing bad ever came from delving too deeply, too greedily."
3/23/25 4:45:56a Sativa says, "useless stuff, like sunstones and altars and catapults and mystics"
3/23/25 4:46:00a Pe Ell says, "Exiles will make the right choice once they've exhausted all other options"
3/23/25 4:46:03a Coriakin says, "That is, unfortunately, a good point Garr"

3/23/25 4:46:33a Eli says, "im more into fast decisions"
3/23/25 4:46:34a Saxifrage asks, "What have you read, redcloak?"

3/23/25 4:47:08a (Phroon squints at some notes he doesn't follow well.)
3/23/25 4:47:16a Katreesa says, "Or we throw Sax in and call it a day"
3/23/25 4:47:18a Pun'isher says, "i feel like something is going to befall us"
3/23/25 4:47:25a Garr says, "I believe this object is what combined the creatures we see here"
3/23/25 4:47:37a Clemence says, "./pray Oh Cone beast, decend from the heavens and push us off this ledge"
3/23/25 4:47:37a Shadowfire says, "Oh great Beast of Cone, grant us the Bounty of your wisdom that we might do foolhardy things without erasing ourselves from existence"

3/23/25 4:47:57a Saxifrage asks, "And what did the smiths say of it?"
3/23/25 4:47:58a Saxifrage has not disclosed his race, is male, is a Windspinner, and is not wearing the symbol of any clan.
3/23/25 4:47:58a He is holding a wooden shield, and he is wearing a sunstone, an amulet of breath, a cloak and a pair of pants.
3/23/25 4:47:58a (is wearing a tattoo)
3/23/25 4:48:04a Biro ponders, "just let me float down :0"
3/23/25 4:48:06a Clemence says, "Pawmen"
3/23/25 4:48:07a Ranissa is now Clanning.
3/23/25 4:48:11a Katreesa says, "if we form a chain and hold onto each other maybe we can reach bottom"
3/23/25 4:48:16a You have 20309 coins.
3/23/25 4:48:17a Pun'isher growls, "oh like share?"

3/23/25 4:48:55a Kalian has fallen to a Crevyrn.

3/23/25 4:50:25a Shadowfire asks, "Praytell, Sister Saxifrage... Have you heard the Good News of Cone Beast?"
3/23/25 4:50:26a Sativa says, "Mzlama? Don't think I have met her"
3/23/25 4:50:27a * You learn from sharing resources.

3/23/25 4:50:40a Pe Ell ponders, "The Metz Llama?"
3/23/25 4:50:41a Seaforth turns to stone.
3/23/25 4:50:45a Seaforth yells, "1"
3/23/25 4:50:46a Inu Teisei asks, "where is seixfridge?"
3/23/25 4:50:48a Shadowfire says, "We might be well advised to offer her a prayer before we do something overly foolhardy"

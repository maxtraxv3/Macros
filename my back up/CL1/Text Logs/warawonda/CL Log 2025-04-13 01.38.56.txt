4/13/25 3:56:37a Cecil yells, "robe seller here if you missed it"
4/13/25 3:56:42a Warawonda says, "hello"
4/13/25 3:56:49a Algernon looks blank.
4/13/25 3:57:02a Spectrum says, "Warawonda, stay close to the lantern's light."
4/13/25 3:57:02a Spectrum says, "Unless you are Dreamless or have the use of a Lantern, do not venture beyond the borders of The Protectorate."
4/13/25 3:57:02a Spectrum says, "Without the moon's protection, you are sure to quickly succumb to the madness of the world around us."

4/13/25 3:57:03a Spectrum says, "Our spiritual guides walk to support a lanternbearer, who can guide lost dreamers back to their own truth."
4/13/25 3:57:04a Spectrum says, "Without our guidance, their spirits may be devoured by Dreamdrinkers or lost forever."
4/13/25 3:57:21a Evenas spreads her hands wide.

4/13/25 3:57:31a Hue says, "Those who are called to serve here leave behind their real names."
4/13/25 3:57:31a Hue says, "This ensures that their story — their past — does not unravel into the fabric of this place."

4/13/25 3:58:05a Gradient says, "Shadow trees began to glow with lambent moonlight, echoed in their lanterns."
4/13/25 3:58:06a Shade says, "We do know that they fill their eggs with the dreams of the living."
4/13/25 3:58:07a Gradient says, "The shadows softened, and danger waned in their island of light."
4/13/25 3:58:07a Shade says, "Before they hatch, their grubs feed on the dreams in the egg."
4/13/25 3:58:08a Gradient says, "So it came to pass that the Dreamless Protectorate established a haven amid the wild waves of shadow."
4/13/25 3:58:16a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."

4/13/25 3:58:26a (Naferu Howls!)
4/13/25 3:58:40a Phroon asks, "They venture around the plane quite a bit, maybe they have a clue?"
4/13/25 3:58:43a (Chroma smiles at Katreesa.)
4/13/25 3:58:43a (Naferu takes a deel breath)
4/13/25 3:58:44a (Coriakin nods)
4/13/25 3:58:45a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "so much lore"
4/13/25 3:58:48a (Sylune smiles)
4/13/25 3:58:48a (Inu Teisei shadows Cori)
4/13/25 3:58:49a Coriakin says, "Perhaps..."
4/13/25 3:58:50a (Naferu howls extra loudly)
4/13/25 3:58:54a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar attempts to pass among the exiles.
4/13/25 3:59:03a Aurelie asks, "Wait...where did Val go?"
4/13/25 3:59:06a Warawonda says, ":)"
4/13/25 3:59:11a (Naferu shrugs)
4/13/25 3:59:12a Aurelie says, "Ah"
4/13/25 3:59:13a Aurelie says, "H'lo"

4/13/25 3:59:21a Kalian says, "over here"
4/13/25 3:59:22a Shade says, "Greetings, Warawonda."
4/13/25 3:59:23a Shade says, "No one knows whether Dreamdrinkers originated on the Plane of Shadow or were drawn here by the smell of the dreams."
4/13/25 4:00:19a Algernon stares into space.
4/13/25 4:00:20a Inu Teisei says, "ya we are"
4/13/25 4:00:23a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers forbidden knowledge about the shape of scary eternity.
4/13/25 4:00:31a Algernon holds his pack protectively.
4/13/25 4:00:33a Crunch ponders, "Was Algy there the whole time?"
4/13/25 4:00:37a Algernon looks nervous.
4/13/25 4:00:46a Algernon takes Amster out of his pack.
4/13/25 4:01:03a (Crunch headbutts Evenas)

4/13/25 4:01:10a Nyarlathotep turns to stone.
4/13/25 4:01:13a (Naferu flicks his ears and listens for any sign)
4/13/25 4:01:16a Coriakin says, "She was lost somewhere in the shadowplane"
4/13/25 4:01:22a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar quietly hums a shadowy tune.
4/13/25 4:01:28a Evenas asks, "A lost dreamer?"
4/13/25 4:01:32a Inu Teisei asks, "chicone?"
4/13/25 4:01:33a Coriakin asks, "Have you or your companions happened to have seen anything that looks like her?"
4/13/25 4:01:38a Coriakin says, "Chaconne, Inu."
4/13/25 4:01:42a Naferu growls, "or sounds like this.."
4/13/25 4:01:44a (Naferu howls!)
4/13/25 4:01:50a Coriakin says, "She's... I don't think she's a dreamer"
4/13/25 4:01:56a Inu Teisei says, "okay I pronounce as Chik Kone"
4/13/25 4:01:56a Coriakin says, "She travelled here with us through one of the rifts"
4/13/25 4:02:01a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 4:02:17a Seaforth thinks, "Is there a next move? Some of us are waiting here in the Protectorate"
4/13/25 4:02:17a Coriakin says, "But was somehow lost when my spirit returned to the material plane"
4/13/25 4:02:22a Catan ponders, "that's dirty Chick cone?"
4/13/25 4:02:28a Ausrine yells, "here"
4/13/25 4:02:31a Coriakin thinks, "We're talkign to Evanas"
4/13/25 4:02:32a Inu Teisei says, "homage to the great Cone Beast™ May her floofy paws guide us"
4/13/25 4:02:37a (Inu Teisei): homage to the great Cone Beast™ May her floofy paws guide us
4/13/25 4:02:37a (Naferu yips sadly)
4/13/25 4:02:42a Sativa says, "haha"
4/13/25 4:02:43a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
4/13/25 4:02:45a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar pats Inu Teisei gently on the shoulder.
4/13/25 4:02:50a Sativa says, "our long journey is at an end"
4/13/25 4:02:58a Seaforth says, "I succesfully led us 10 steps, Manquilor"
4/13/25 4:03:00a Sativa says, "great work expedition team"
4/13/25 4:03:04a (Manquilor cheers!)
4/13/25 4:03:09a You can't tell whether Evenas is lost in thought or just forgot to reply.
4/13/25 4:03:11a (Inu Teisei): not yet Inut whines wines dines spines
4/13/25 4:03:12a (Valadorei grins)
4/13/25 4:03:20a Coriakin says, "I'm hoping she's still out there somewhere, but...."
4/13/25 4:03:22a Warawonda asks, "are not ment to seek out the devourer of dreams?"
4/13/25 4:03:29a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers forbidden knowledge about the shape of scary eternity.
4/13/25 4:03:38a Evenas exclaims, "Seek and destroy, yes!"
4/13/25 4:03:41a Sylune asks, "We have found some Oubleir deep within the Forest here. Is there anything that can be done for them?"
4/13/25 4:03:50a Evenas says, "Lost little foxes. We can only recover some who are lost here."
4/13/25 4:03:59a Sativa asks, "did anyone hear of the name Evenas?"
4/13/25 4:04:01a (Inu Teisei asks SC to help provide Evenas guidance for Chaconne (chik connie))
4/13/25 4:04:03a Evenas says, "Ah, the Oubleir. Dreamers, but not Lost."
4/13/25 4:04:06a Crunch says in Ghorak Zo, "Strim Evenas, if these people start boring you, I'm sure we'll have more violence soon"
4/13/25 4:04:11a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 4:04:13a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar practices cackling.
4/13/25 4:04:16a (Evenas nods approvingly to Crunch.)
4/13/25 4:04:21a (Coriakin blinks)
4/13/25 4:04:22a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar tells Inu Teisei secrets it overheard.
4/13/25 4:04:30a You are now speaking the ghorak zo language.
4/13/25 4:04:32a Evenas says, "If the Oubleir found your fox, perhaps she is still yipping in their forest."
4/13/25 4:04:32a Coriakin asks, "Dreaming but not lost?"
4/13/25 4:04:33a Warawonda says in Ghorak Zo, "hmm"
4/13/25 4:04:35a (Aurelie suddently bursts out into a laugh but contains it.)
4/13/25 4:04:36a (Dandelion hides a smile)
4/13/25 4:04:39a You are now speaking the common language.
4/13/25 4:04:40a Coriakin asks, "Do you think she's chosen to remain here?"
4/13/25 4:04:41a Evenas says, "It is a dark and tangled place, but they are hard to waken."
4/13/25 4:04:41a (Valadorei giggles softly.)
4/13/25 4:04:42a (Aurelie giggles at Valadorei.)
4/13/25 4:04:42a (Naferu's ears perk up)
4/13/25 4:04:52a Inu Teisei thinks, "come here Chaconne, come out, come out, wherever you are <3"
4/13/25 4:04:58a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
4/13/25 4:05:11a Coriakin says, "I suppose there's no way to know."
4/13/25 4:05:12a (Eirian Caldwell hopes Coriakin and his little fox find one another)
4/13/25 4:05:14a Inu Teisei thinks, "all ye all ye pumkin, free free free"
4/13/25 4:05:21a Aurelie ponders, "What if the Chaconne that we find...is not the Chaconne that we lost?..."
4/13/25 4:05:21a Evenas asks, "Have you tried asking a baby mantuan?"
4/13/25 4:05:22a Coriakin says, "But the forest, you say? That place is dangerous"
4/13/25 4:05:34a Sylune asks, "If the Oubiler have become one with the fabric of the forest are they not lost?"
4/13/25 4:05:34a Coriakin says, "I suppose they say a mantuan never forgets"
4/13/25 4:05:45a Warawonda asks, "do you know of witch part we should search?"
4/13/25 4:05:45a Sylune asks, "Or still we can do something for them?"
4/13/25 4:05:47a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar gives a gentle caress.
4/13/25 4:05:52a Katreesa says, "perhaps she'll be a werechaconne"
4/13/25 4:06:00a Coriakin says, "I suppose it's nonsensical enough to make sense in this madness"
4/13/25 4:06:02a Chef Haricot thinks, "Bonjour my good friends! Did you forget to eat today? I cure famishment."
4/13/25 4:06:15a Evenas says, "It's complicated."
4/13/25 4:06:19a Sylune ponders, "There's a baby mantuan in the Garden I think"
4/13/25 4:06:19a Crunch ponders, "I did forget to eat today"
4/13/25 4:06:20a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 4:06:24a Noivad thinks, "shoes are food"
4/13/25 4:06:25a Inu Teisei thinks, "it better not be Chaconne, Haricot!"
4/13/25 4:06:32a (Evenas clenches and unclenches her first.)
4/13/25 4:06:34a Warawonda asks, "perhaps you can show us?"
4/13/25 4:06:36a (Evenas clenches and unclenches her fist.)
4/13/25 4:06:47a Warawonda says, "or send someone to show us"
4/13/25 4:06:47a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar sings Inu Teisei a song woven from shadows.
4/13/25 4:06:48a Catan ponders, "Chaconne Horus the Ranger?"
4/13/25 4:06:52a * Your mental enhancement fades.
4/13/25 4:06:54a * Your mental enhancement fades.
4/13/25 4:07:00a (Evenas waves a hand around.)
4/13/25 4:07:05a Sativa exclaims, "hi!"
4/13/25 4:07:07a Coriakin says, "Hmm"
4/13/25 4:07:08a Evenas says, "These guardians would hardly be able to put their pants on without me."
4/13/25 4:07:13a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 4:07:17a (Warawonda nods)
4/13/25 4:07:19a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
4/13/25 4:07:20a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 4:07:20a Inu Teisei asks, "can you tell algernon then?"
4/13/25 4:07:23a Catan ponders, "Come on was not a bad one ... CHuck Norris .."
4/13/25 4:07:25a Evenas asks, "Tell him what?"
4/13/25 4:07:34a Inu Teisei says, "where chaconne is"
4/13/25 4:07:35a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "pantsless guardians?"
4/13/25 4:07:40a Inu Teisei says, "so he can lead us"
4/13/25 4:07:46a Sativa says, "aww Algy, love that lil guy"
4/13/25 4:07:48a Kevas ponders, "most of them wear robes. Who could tell?"
4/13/25 4:07:48a Evenas asks, "Uh, have you met Algernon?"
4/13/25 4:07:54a Inu Teisei says, "not really"
4/13/25 4:07:56a (Eirian Caldwell chuckles.)
4/13/25 4:07:57a (Naferu nods)
4/13/25 4:08:05a Inu Teisei says, "but i hear great stories about him"
4/13/25 4:08:06a Catan ponders, "what is going on ?"
4/13/25 4:08:07a (Phroon laughs a little.)
4/13/25 4:08:08a (Manquilor goes to hug Algy)
4/13/25 4:08:10a Sativa says, "He has a kind heart and a funny accent"
4/13/25 4:08:14a Warawonda asks, "is there away to locate or any signs to look for when tracking him down?"
4/13/25 4:08:14a Evenas says, "Let's just say other people always helped put his pants on."
4/13/25 4:08:15a Coriakin says, "Algernon wasn't known for saying much. Or for adventuring outside of town"
4/13/25 4:08:22a Inu Teisei says, "lol"
4/13/25 4:08:25a Inu Teisei says, "roftl"
4/13/25 4:08:28a (Eirian Caldwell snickers.)
4/13/25 4:08:28a (Inu Teisei is Rolling on the floor laughing)
4/13/25 4:08:28a Aurelie says, "Agernon is...right there"
4/13/25 4:08:30a (Inu Teisei recovers her composure)
4/13/25 4:08:37a Kevas says, "Well, he went on many adventures. Usually not by his own choice."
4/13/25 4:08:43a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 4:08:44a Seaforth says, "mao"
4/13/25 4:08:45a Sativa exclaims, "arr!"
4/13/25 4:08:47a Seaforth says, "lmao"
4/13/25 4:08:49a Inu Teisei says, "Algernon run south"
4/13/25 4:08:50a Naferu ponders, "Didn't Gorvin send him on a couple of advenures..."
4/13/25 4:08:50a Evenas says, "That's right. So you want to kidnap him? It's tradition."
4/13/25 4:08:50a Crunch says, "Oh, uh, sorry for pantsing Algy all those times"
4/13/25 4:09:00a Sativa exclaims, "hi!"
4/13/25 4:09:06a Evenas says, "I'm not sure that would help with your questions, though."
4/13/25 4:09:10a Inu Teisei says, "oh okay"
4/13/25 4:09:11a Sativa says, "Algernon run east"
4/13/25 4:09:13a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 4:09:14a Inu Teisei says, "maybe another time then"
4/13/25 4:09:21a Inu Teisei yells, "manqy run south"
4/13/25 4:09:22a Manquilor exclaims, "oh!"
4/13/25 4:09:23a Evenas says, "I really think you should ask one of those little guys with the trunks."
4/13/25 4:09:25a Sativa asks, "anyone got flowers?"
4/13/25 4:09:27a (Manquilor hugs Algy!)
4/13/25 4:09:37a Sativa says, "algy <-- if curious"
4/13/25 4:09:38a Evenas says, "The Shadowplane always tries getting our coteries to talk to them."
4/13/25 4:09:44a Sativa says, "a lil purpley but seeems fine"
4/13/25 4:09:46a (Phroon scratches his head.)
4/13/25 4:09:47a Evenas says, "In its way."
4/13/25 4:09:50a Seaforth says, "What I am hearing is that we are to look for a small elephant"
4/13/25 4:09:52a Inu Teisei asks, "coteries?"
4/13/25 4:10:01a Coriakin says, "Sounds like it, Seaforth"
4/13/25 4:10:03a Inu Teisei asks, "do you have secret decoder ring?"
4/13/25 4:10:05a Evenas says, "Yeah, stuffy guy with the shiny armor, that's right."
4/13/25 4:10:12a (Eirian Caldwell laughs.)
4/13/25 4:10:12a Seaforth says, "Cadres. Groups."
4/13/25 4:10:14a Kevas ponders, "Do any of us speak Mantuan?"
4/13/25 4:10:15a Coriakin says, "Or to see if the Oublier in the shadow forest will talk to us"
4/13/25 4:10:16a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 4:10:18a (Inu Teisei show)
4/13/25 4:10:25a Inu Teisei shows her shadowy collar to everyone.
4/13/25 4:10:36a Evenas says, "It babbles a lot, and it's mostly nonsense. That's some of the dark we're keeping at bay."
4/13/25 4:10:38a Inu Teisei says, "something liek this but in ring form"
4/13/25 4:10:39a Warawonda says, "so how do we find this devourer of dreams"
4/13/25 4:10:52a Inu Teisei exclaims, "oh here I can help with that!"
4/13/25 4:10:56a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar fades in and out of existence.
4/13/25 4:10:59a Seaforth says, "I do not speak Mantuan, Kevas, but I am a philologist."
4/13/25 4:11:01a Sativa asks, "and what do they taste like?"
4/13/25 4:11:04a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar attempts to pass among the exiles.
4/13/25 4:11:05a Evenas says, "Some of you are spattered with dreamdrinker juices already."
4/13/25 4:11:08a Sylune says, "The Oubleir have not yet had anything to say to us I believe"
4/13/25 4:11:18a Crunch throws a bottle of dark green paint!

4/13/25 5:27:48a Chroma says, "She found her way to the Crooked Tree, where memories swell and ripen before joining the Blackblaze."
4/13/25 5:27:48a Chroma says, "The tree's fruit, as it ripens, slowly drops into the sky."

4/13/25 5:27:48a Chroma says, "Mataline jumped to catch a plum as it dropped, and fell drifting into the swirling sky."
4/13/25 5:27:48a Chroma says, "She tumbled helplessly, plum clutched tight in her fist…"

4/13/25 5:27:50a Gradient says, "Shaer’s initial attempts to build a fortress in the Plane of Shadow were unsuccessful."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "We do know that they fill their eggs with the dreams of the living."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "Before they hatch, their grubs feed on the dreams in the egg."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "These grubs are sometimes sought by seers for their ability to foretell the future."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "Do not trust their words. Not every dream is a true-seeing."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "The Plane of Shadow is always contradicting itself."

4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "It is not omniscient."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Shade says, "It is not to be trusted."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Gradient says, "Nothing he built would last, save the dark side of the Gate of the Moon that returned to his home."
4/13/25 5:27:50a Phroon says, "Well, it's something to do"
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "While his attempts to build faltered, Shaer’s call was a great success."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "From all the world around, healers answered the call to serve in his Dreamless Protectorate."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "Soon, enough protectors had passed through the Gate of the Moon."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "Shaer and his Protectorate were able to vouchsafe passage to all those who dreamed at night."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Phroon says, "I think it's less bad as Stinky thought."
4/13/25 5:27:51a •You notice that you're able to increase others' accuracy more.
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "Although no edifice could be constructed, the healers carried the moon’s strength with them."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "As they stayed in the Plane of Shadow, their moon magic began to shape the nature of the shadow around them."
4/13/25 5:27:51a Gradient says, "Shadow trees began to glow with lambent moonlight, echoed in their lanterns."
4/13/25 5:27:52a Gradient says, "The shadows softened, and danger waned in their island of light."
4/13/25 5:27:52a Gradient says, "So it came to pass that the Dreamless Protectorate established a haven amid the wild waves of shadow."
4/13/25 5:27:52a Coriakin thinks, "If you hear the music, follow it...."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "Greetings, Eirian Caldwell."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "No one knows whether Dreamdrinkers originated on the Plane of Shadow or were drawn here by the smell of the dreams."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "We do know that they fill their eggs with the dreams of the living."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Greetings, Warawonda."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Long ago, when the world was young, no one dreamed."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Each eventide the Second Children found perfect repose until the following daybreak, when they woke refreshed."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Nothing perfect ever lasts, and soon enough, the world changed."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "Before they hatch, their grubs feed on the dreams in the egg."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Most of the Children began to dream, their spirits traveling across planes…"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "…to a terrifying, wonderful phantasmagoria from which they emerged subtly changed each night."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Some were terrified by their experiences, while others were elated by their explorations."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "These grubs are sometimes sought by seers for their ability to foretell the future."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Eventually, all of the Second Children became accustomed to their nocturnal perambulations."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Scholars studied the night travels of their spirits and developed a hypothesis…"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "…each night, the spirits were being drawn by the call of a nearby plane, the plane of Shadow."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Having sated their curiosity, all was well until dreamers began not to return to their bodies by daybreak."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Shaer, leader of the Order of Healers, led an investigation into the phenomenon of the unwaking."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "Do not trust their words. Not every dream is a true-seeing."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Shaer and his healers were able to determine that the plane of dreaming was home to predators—"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "—Dreamdrinkers, as they came to be known, who fed on the spirits traveling there."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "To protect the spirits of his people, Shaer commissioned the construction of a great gate."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "The Plane of Shadow is always contradicting itself."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "The Gate, known as the Gateway of the Moon, would allow him to personally cross planes while waking."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Shaer put out a call for other spiritual guides to join him."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "He called to those children who never dreamed to become healers and stand by his side—"
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "It dances with the minds of others."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "—to stand in spiritual fortitude against the chaos and danger of the Plane of Shadow."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "Shaer vowed to establish a bastion of safety in the Plane of Shadow."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Gradient says, "He swore he would remain there to safeguard travelers until the day children stopped traveling in dreams."
4/13/25 5:27:53a Shade says, "It is not omniscient."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Shaer’s initial attempts to build a fortress in the Plane of Shadow were unsuccessful."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Quarried stone would take wing and fly away; vines would overgrow and decompose lumber."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Shade says, "It is not to be trusted."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Nothing he built would last, save the dark side of the Gate of the Moon that returned to his home."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "While his attempts to build faltered, Shaer’s call was a great success."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "From all the world around, healers answered the call to serve in his Dreamless Protectorate."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Soon, enough protectors had passed through the Gate of the Moon."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Shaer and his Protectorate were able to vouchsafe passage to all those who dreamed at night."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Although no edifice could be constructed, the healers carried the moon’s strength with them."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "As they stayed in the Plane of Shadow, their moon magic began to shape the nature of the shadow around them."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "Shadow trees began to glow with lambent moonlight, echoed in their lanterns."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "The shadows softened, and danger waned in their island of light."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Gradient says, "So it came to pass that the Dreamless Protectorate established a haven amid the wild waves of shadow."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:27:54a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:27:54a Cecil yells, "does any healer want a blue robe?"
4/13/25 5:27:56a You just received anonymous good karma.
4/13/25 5:27:56a Cecil yells, "robe seller here if you missed it"
4/13/25 5:27:57a Warawonda says, "hello"
4/13/25 5:27:58a Algernon looks blank.
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Warawonda, stay close to the lantern's light."
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Unless you are Dreamless or have the use of a Lantern, do not venture beyond the borders of The Protectorate."
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Without the moon's protection, you are sure to quickly succumb to the madness of the world around us."
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Coteries of Dreamless venture forth into the dark paths of shadow to rescue those who are lost."
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Our spiritual guides walk to support a lanternbearer, who can guide lost dreamers back to their own truth."
4/13/25 5:27:59a Spectrum says, "Without our guidance, their spirits may be devoured by Dreamdrinkers or lost forever."
4/13/25 5:28:02a Evenas spreads her hands wide.
4/13/25 5:28:02a Evenas says, "Strim, Warawonda. Welcome to the Dreamless Protectorate."
4/13/25 5:28:02a Evenas says, "Those who are called here follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:28:02a Evenas says, "We who do not dream are called on to protect those who do from the predators of this land."
4/13/25 5:28:03a Evenas says, "We are guides and protectors, and stand strong in spirit against the darkness of night."
4/13/25 5:28:03a Evenas says, "We stand bright against the confusion and the untold dangers within this world."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "Welcome to our refuge against madness, Warawonda."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "In the Plane of Shadow, much is not as it seems."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "Those who are called to serve here leave behind their real names."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "This ensures that their story — their past — does not unravel into the fabric of this place."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "A name has power, and those who carry their names with them may be at risk of losing themselves."
4/13/25 5:28:05a Hue says, "We hold our true names close for safekeeping to help us return to ourselves when our service is complete."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Warawonda, stay close to the lantern's light."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Unless you are Dreamless or have the use of a Lantern, do not venture beyond the borders of The Protectorate."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Without the moon's protection, you are sure to quickly succumb to the madness of the world around us."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Coteries of Dreamless venture forth into the dark paths of shadow to rescue those who are lost."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Our spiritual guides walk to support a lanternbearer, who can guide lost dreamers back to their own truth."
4/13/25 5:28:06a Spectrum says, "Without our guidance, their spirits may be devoured by Dreamdrinkers or lost forever."
4/13/25 5:28:08a Hue says, "Welcome to our refuge against madness, Eirian Caldwell."
4/13/25 5:28:09a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 5:28:09a Hue says, "Those who are called to serve here leave behind their real names."
4/13/25 5:28:09a Gradient says, "Shadow trees began to glow with lambent moonlight, echoed in their lanterns."
4/13/25 5:28:09a Shade says, "We do know that they fill their eggs with the dreams of the living."
4/13/25 5:28:09a Gradient says, "The shadows softened, and danger waned in their island of light."
4/13/25 5:28:09a Shade says, "Before they hatch, their grubs feed on the dreams in the egg."
4/13/25 5:28:09a Gradient says, "So it came to pass that the Dreamless Protectorate established a haven amid the wild waves of shadow."
4/13/25 5:28:10a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:28:10a Tint asks, "Would you like to purchase the robes of our order?"
4/13/25 5:28:10a Tint says, "I only sell to those who follow the Way of the Candle."
4/13/25 5:28:11a (Naferu Howls!)
4/13/25 5:28:12a Phroon asks, "They venture around the plane quite a bit, maybe they have a clue?"
4/13/25 5:28:13a (Chroma smiles at Katreesa.)
4/13/25 5:28:14a (Naferu takes a deel breath)
4/13/25 5:28:16a (Coriakin nods)
4/13/25 5:28:16a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "so much lore"
4/13/25 5:28:18a (Sylune smiles)
4/13/25 5:28:18a (Inu Teisei shadows Cori)
4/13/25 5:28:18a Coriakin says, "Perhaps..."
4/13/25 5:28:18a (Naferu howls extra loudly)
4/13/25 5:28:19a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar attempts to pass among the exiles.
4/13/25 5:28:36a Aurelie asks, "Wait...where did Val go?"
4/13/25 5:28:37a Warawonda says, ":)"
4/13/25 5:28:37a (Naferu shrugs)
4/13/25 5:28:37a Aurelie says, "Ah"
4/13/25 5:28:38a Aurelie says, "H'lo"
4/13/25 5:28:38a (Naferu listens)
4/13/25 5:28:38a Coriakin asks, "Where's the leader of this place again?"
4/13/25 5:28:38a Coriakin asks, "Where's the leader of this place again?"
4/13/25 5:28:39a Kalian says, "over here"
4/13/25 5:28:39a Shade says, "Greetings, Warawonda."
4/13/25 5:28:39a Shade says, "No one knows whether Dreamdrinkers originated on the Plane of Shadow or were drawn here by the smell of the dreams."
4/13/25 5:28:44a Algernon stares into space.
4/13/25 5:28:44a Inu Teisei says, "ya we are"
4/13/25 5:28:44a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers forbidden knowledge about the shape of scary eternity.
4/13/25 5:28:45a Algernon holds his pack protectively.
4/13/25 5:28:45a Crunch ponders, "Was Algy there the whole time?"
4/13/25 5:28:45a Algernon looks nervous.
4/13/25 5:29:04a Algernon takes Amster out of his pack.
4/13/25 5:29:32a (Crunch headbutts Evenas)
4/13/25 5:29:32a (Eirian Caldwell chuckles.)
4/13/25 5:29:33a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 5:29:33a Coriakin says, "A frost foxweir that looks like Naferu"
4/13/25 5:29:33a Nyarlathotep turns to stone.
4/13/25 5:29:33a (Naferu flicks his ears and listens for any sign)
4/13/25 5:29:34a Coriakin says, "She was lost somewhere in the shadowplane"
4/13/25 5:29:35a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar quietly hums a shadowy tune.
4/13/25 5:29:36a Evenas asks, "A lost dreamer?"
4/13/25 5:29:36a Inu Teisei asks, "chicone?"
4/13/25 5:29:36a Coriakin asks, "Have you or your companions happened to have seen anything that looks like her?"
4/13/25 5:29:38a Coriakin says, "Chaconne, Inu."
4/13/25 5:29:38a Naferu growls, "or sounds like this.."
4/13/25 5:29:40a (Naferu howls!)
4/13/25 5:29:41a Coriakin says, "She's... I don't think she's a dreamer"
4/13/25 5:29:43a Inu Teisei says, "okay I pronounce as Chik Kone"
4/13/25 5:29:43a Coriakin says, "She travelled here with us through one of the rifts"
4/13/25 5:29:44a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 5:30:02a Seaforth thinks, "Is there a next move? Some of us are waiting here in the Protectorate"
4/13/25 5:30:02a Coriakin says, "But was somehow lost when my spirit returned to the material plane"
4/13/25 5:30:02a Catan ponders, "that's dirty Chick cone?"
4/13/25 5:30:03a Ausrine yells, "here"
4/13/25 5:30:03a Coriakin thinks, "We're talkign to Evanas"
4/13/25 5:30:03a Inu Teisei says, "homage to the great Cone Beast™ May her floofy paws guide us"
4/13/25 5:30:03a (Inu Teisei): homage to the great Cone Beast™ May her floofy paws guide us
4/13/25 5:30:03a (Naferu yips sadly)
4/13/25 5:30:04a Sativa says, "haha"
4/13/25 5:30:04a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
4/13/25 5:30:04a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar pats Inu Teisei gently on the shoulder.
4/13/25 5:30:04a Sativa says, "our long journey is at an end"
4/13/25 5:30:05a Seaforth says, "I succesfully led us 10 steps, Manquilor"
4/13/25 5:30:05a Sativa says, "great work expedition team"
4/13/25 5:30:06a (Manquilor cheers!)
4/13/25 5:30:06a You can't tell whether Evenas is lost in thought or just forgot to reply.
4/13/25 5:30:06a (Inu Teisei): not yet Inut whines wines dines spines
4/13/25 5:30:06a (Valadorei grins)
4/13/25 5:30:07a Coriakin says, "I'm hoping she's still out there somewhere, but...."
4/13/25 5:30:07a Warawonda asks, "are not ment to seek out the devourer of dreams?"
4/13/25 5:30:08a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers forbidden knowledge about the shape of scary eternity.
4/13/25 5:30:08a Evenas exclaims, "Seek and destroy, yes!"
4/13/25 5:30:09a Sylune asks, "We have found some Oubleir deep within the Forest here. Is there anything that can be done for them?"
4/13/25 5:30:09a Evenas says, "Lost little foxes. We can only recover some who are lost here."
4/13/25 5:30:10a Sativa asks, "did anyone hear of the name Evenas?"
4/13/25 5:30:10a (Inu Teisei asks SC to help provide Evenas guidance for Chaconne (chik connie))
4/13/25 5:30:11a Evenas says, "Ah, the Oubleir. Dreamers, but not Lost."
4/13/25 5:30:11a Crunch says in Ghorak Zo, "Strim Evenas, if these people start boring you, I'm sure we'll have more violence soon"
4/13/25 5:30:11a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 5:30:11a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar practices cackling.
4/13/25 5:30:12a (Evenas nods approvingly to Crunch.)
4/13/25 5:30:12a (Coriakin blinks)
4/13/25 5:30:12a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar tells Inu Teisei secrets it overheard.
4/13/25 5:30:13a You are now speaking the ghorak zo language.
4/13/25 5:30:13a Evenas says, "If the Oubleir found your fox, perhaps she is still yipping in their forest."
4/13/25 5:30:13a Coriakin asks, "Dreaming but not lost?"
4/13/25 5:30:13a Warawonda says in Ghorak Zo, "hmm"
4/13/25 5:30:13a (Aurelie suddently bursts out into a laugh but contains it.)
4/13/25 5:30:13a (Dandelion hides a smile)
4/13/25 5:30:14a You are now speaking the common language.
4/13/25 5:30:14a Coriakin asks, "Do you think she's chosen to remain here?"
4/13/25 5:30:14a Evenas says, "It is a dark and tangled place, but they are hard to waken."
4/13/25 5:30:14a (Valadorei giggles softly.)
4/13/25 5:30:14a (Aurelie giggles at Valadorei.)
4/13/25 5:30:14a (Naferu's ears perk up)
4/13/25 5:30:15a Inu Teisei thinks, "come here Chaconne, come out, come out, wherever you are <3"
4/13/25 5:30:15a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
4/13/25 5:30:16a Coriakin says, "I suppose there's no way to know."
4/13/25 5:30:16a (Eirian Caldwell hopes Coriakin and his little fox find one another)
4/13/25 5:30:16a Inu Teisei thinks, "all ye all ye pumkin, free free free"
4/13/25 5:30:17a Aurelie ponders, "What if the Chaconne that we find...is not the Chaconne that we lost?..."
4/13/25 5:30:17a Evenas asks, "Have you tried asking a baby mantuan?"
4/13/25 5:30:17a Coriakin says, "But the forest, you say? That place is dangerous"
4/13/25 5:30:18a Sylune asks, "If the Oubiler have become one with the fabric of the forest are they not lost?"
4/13/25 5:30:18a Coriakin says, "I suppose they say a mantuan never forgets"
4/13/25 5:30:19a Warawonda asks, "do you know of witch part we should search?"
4/13/25 5:30:19a Sylune asks, "Or still we can do something for them?"
4/13/25 5:30:19a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar gives a gentle caress.
4/13/25 5:30:20a Katreesa says, "perhaps she'll be a werechaconne"
4/13/25 5:30:20a Coriakin says, "I suppose it's nonsensical enough to make sense in this madness"
4/13/25 5:30:20a Chef Haricot thinks, "Bonjour my good friends! Did you forget to eat today? I cure famishment."
4/13/25 5:30:22a Evenas says, "It's complicated."
4/13/25 5:30:22a Sylune ponders, "There's a baby mantuan in the Garden I think"
4/13/25 5:30:22a Crunch ponders, "I did forget to eat today"
4/13/25 5:30:22a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 5:30:22a Noivad thinks, "shoes are food"
4/13/25 5:30:22a Inu Teisei thinks, "it better not be Chaconne, Haricot!"
4/13/25 5:30:23a (Evenas clenches and unclenches her first.)
4/13/25 5:30:23a Warawonda asks, "perhaps you can show us?"
4/13/25 5:30:23a (Evenas clenches and unclenches her fist.)
4/13/25 5:30:24a Warawonda says, "or send someone to show us"
4/13/25 5:30:24a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar sings Inu Teisei a song woven from shadows.
4/13/25 5:30:24a Catan ponders, "Chaconne Horus the Ranger?"
4/13/25 5:30:25a * Your mental enhancement fades.
4/13/25 5:30:25a * Your mental enhancement fades.
4/13/25 5:30:25a (Evenas waves a hand around.)
4/13/25 5:30:26a Sativa exclaims, "hi!"
4/13/25 5:30:26a Coriakin says, "Hmm"
4/13/25 5:30:26a Evenas says, "These guardians would hardly be able to put their pants on without me."
4/13/25 5:30:26a You have 21999 coins.
4/13/25 5:30:27a (Warawonda nods)
4/13/25 5:30:27a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
4/13/25 5:30:27a (Phroon nods.)
4/13/25 5:30:27a Inu Teisei asks, "can you tell algernon then?"
4/13/25 5:30:27a Catan ponders, "Come on was not a bad one ... CHuck Norris .."

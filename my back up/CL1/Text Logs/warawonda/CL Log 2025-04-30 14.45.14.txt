4/30/25 4:17:21p Semie says, "not a lot"
4/30/25 4:17:30p Bashak says, "oh thought it was a cool item"
4/30/25 4:17:31p You slip your Sword of Shadows into your backpack.
4/30/25 4:17:37p Semie says, "if you lewave it they grow like zu and drop seeds"
4/30/25 4:17:40p Bashak says, "ah"
4/30/25 4:17:47p * Bashak recovers the Large Vermine fur, worth 1c. Your share is 1c.
4/30/25 4:18:31p Semie slips between the wet rocks.
4/30/25 4:18:46p Nemo asks, "Ah, Semie. My fine boats cost 20 copper pennies. Would you like to rent one now?"
4/30/25 4:18:47p Semie says, "yes"
4/30/25 4:18:49p Nemo asks, "Ah, Warawonda. My fine boats cost 20 copper pennies. Would you like to rent one now?"
4/30/25 4:18:50p Warawonda whispers, "yes"
4/30/25 4:19:21p Shadowfire says, "Not saying it won't let you kill a bunch of things"
4/30/25 4:19:26p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:19:26p Bashak exclaims, "woohoo! thanks!"
4/30/25 4:19:27p Shadowfire says, "But if you're alone and trapped"
4/30/25 4:19:29p Fortuna has fallen.
4/30/25 4:19:31p Warawonda says, "np"
4/30/25 4:19:35p Shadowfire says, "It isn't likely to be enough to get you out"
4/30/25 4:19:37p Lady Dragon says, "well if your alone you did something wrong"
4/30/25 4:19:47p Shadowfire says, "Sometimes situations go wrong"
4/30/25 4:20:04p Warawonda says, "um"
4/30/25 4:20:10p Shadowfire says, "Also labrys AE doesn't clear your front arc"
4/30/25 4:20:10p Fortuna is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:20:14p Warawonda says, "how long has fort been down"
4/30/25 4:20:16p Shadowfire says, "So even if you can kill things quickly"
4/30/25 4:20:19p Warawonda says, "oh nvm"
4/30/25 4:20:29p Shadowfire says, "you won't be going anywhere"
4/30/25 4:20:40p Shadowfire says, "Until you've killed most of whatever pile you find yourself in"
4/30/25 4:20:46p Fortuna is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:20:55p Shadowfire says, "Because more will trickle in in the 4 frame swing cooldown"
4/30/25 4:21:16p Shadowfire says, "Charge has helped that a lot"
4/30/25 4:21:20p Semie exclaims, "that's why you should get 12 swings!"
4/30/25 4:21:24p Shadowfire says, "But pre-charge it was horrifying"
4/30/25 4:21:25p Lady Dragon asks, "are you talking whrilwind or just frontal attack?"
4/30/25 4:21:33p Shadowfire says, "Frontal cone"
4/30/25 4:21:42p Lady Dragon says, "hmmm"
4/30/25 4:21:43p Shadowfire says, "Spin doesn't really work because the damage is spread"
4/30/25 4:21:53p Shadowfire says, "I've gone boosted darkite spin in VT"
4/30/25 4:21:58p Shadowfire says, "And most of the vermine end up yellow or green"
4/30/25 4:22:07p Warawonda ponders, "maybe 5.2 swing, and just train regia til infante"
4/30/25 4:22:27p Lady Dragon says, "i dunno"
4/30/25 4:22:34p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:22:53p Lady Dragon says, "it is true rangers with morph troil can outlast us"
4/30/25 4:23:13p Lady Dragon says, "hence i was suggesting some kinda armor boost"
4/30/25 4:23:18p Shadowfire says, "The funny part"
4/30/25 4:23:31p Shadowfire says, "Rangers are meant to be the "flash in the pan" subclass"
4/30/25 4:23:48p Shadowfire says, "And they aren't lol"
4/30/25 4:23:52p Warawonda says, "x for dout"
4/30/25 4:24:10p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
4/30/25 4:24:44p Lady Dragon says, "i guess it just depends on how you look at things for the class"
4/30/25 4:25:05p Lady Dragon says, "for example who can brick otissa"
4/30/25 4:25:18p Shadowfire says, "idk Wara show me a champion with 3000 troilus and respin"
4/30/25 4:25:24p Crius yells, "It’s 11 o’clock, and all’s well."
4/30/25 4:25:36p Shadowfire says, "And I will change my mind"
4/30/25 4:25:46p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:25:46p Shadowfire says, "Nobody yet"
4/30/25 4:25:56p Warawonda says, "no, no i was agreeing with you :P"
4/30/25 4:26:01p Shadowfire says, "aaah I see"
4/30/25 4:26:15p Lady Dragon says, "i wouldnt want to train 3k troil"
4/30/25 4:26:19p Shadowfire says, "We're pretty much good at exactly 1 thing"
4/30/25 4:26:22p Shadowfire says, "Well"
4/30/25 4:26:24p Shadowfire says, "2 things"
4/30/25 4:26:33p Shadowfire says, "Peak defense at 10k ranks"
4/30/25 4:26:43p Shadowfire says, "And being overpowered library bot alts"
4/30/25 4:27:10p (Lady Dragon shrugs)
4/30/25 4:27:29p Shadowfire says, "Me either"
4/30/25 4:27:35p Shadowfire says, "And rangers don't have to"
4/30/25 4:27:45p Shadowfire says, "Kalian doesn't have 4500 troilus"
4/30/25 4:27:57p Shadowfire says, "But he gets 4500 troilus of regen when in WP morph"
4/30/25 4:28:11p This bench provided by The Puddleby Civic Beautification Society.
4/30/25 4:28:21p Lady Dragon asks, "does he have the amount of troil trained to support it?"
4/30/25 4:28:28p Shadowfire asks, "?"
4/30/25 4:28:32p Warawonda says, "yeah"
4/30/25 4:28:39p Lady Dragon says, "you dont get the troil for free"
4/30/25 4:28:39p Shadowfire says, "He has stated that he gets ~600 Faustus worth of healing"
4/30/25 4:28:53p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:28:57p Shadowfire says, "And rangers get effectively free troilus from Farly/Bangus"
4/30/25 4:28:58p Warawonda says, "no"
4/30/25 4:29:09p Warawonda says, "thats 1200 fastus"
4/30/25 4:29:20p Warawonda says, "pretty sure"
4/30/25 4:29:21p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
4/30/25 4:29:27p Shadowfire says, "I may have remembered the math wrong"
4/30/25 4:29:37p Shadowfire says, "So I stand corrected if I was mistaken"
4/30/25 4:29:42p Lady Dragon says, "hehe all good"
4/30/25 4:29:54p Shadowfire says, "Still, he didn't have to train that troilus"
4/30/25 4:30:08p Shadowfire says, "Some of it sure, but probably got most of it 'free' from Farly/Bangus"
4/30/25 4:30:27p Warawonda says, "i should make healer just self heal super well for no reason"
4/30/25 4:31:05p Shadowfire says, "That one I did the math ononce"
4/30/25 4:31:06p Shadowfire says, "That one I did the math on once"
4/30/25 4:31:15p Warawonda says, "yeah its not a good idea"
4/30/25 4:31:19p Warawonda says, "heh"
4/30/25 4:31:39p Shadowfire says, "Not saying we can't be effective"
4/30/25 4:31:51p Shadowfire says, "But we're pretty much never going to be /as effective/"
4/30/25 4:32:00p Semie is no longer Clanning.
4/30/25 4:32:01p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:32:07p Shadowfire says, "The 'ceiling' is much lower, even if the 'floor' is higher from CM"
4/30/25 4:32:17p Warawonda says, "i mean just train till metta the untrain into fighter"
4/30/25 4:32:18p Lady Dragon asks, "but does really matter?"
4/30/25 4:32:24p Warawonda says, "keep the healer ring"
4/30/25 4:32:32p Warawonda says, "and self heal with ranger spirit"
4/30/25 4:32:38p Warawonda says, "respin"
4/30/25 4:32:45p Warawonda says, "untill a GM finds out"
4/30/25 4:32:48p Warawonda says, ":P"
4/30/25 4:32:51p Shadowfire says, "You can't change professions with untrain"
4/30/25 4:32:53p Lady Dragon says, "if you LIKE being a champ then embrace the good with the bad"
4/30/25 4:33:03p Shadowfire says, "So no exploits there"
4/30/25 4:33:06p Warawonda asks, "oh cant do that now?"
4/30/25 4:33:09p Shadowfire says, "Nope"
4/30/25 4:33:15p Shadowfire says, "That I know for a certainty"
4/30/25 4:33:24p Shadowfire says, "Osha did enough untrain shenanigans to test it"
4/30/25 4:33:41p Lady Dragon says, "you have to get below 3rd cir to loose your class"
4/30/25 4:33:53p Warawonda says, "i mean shouldnt be able to"
4/30/25 4:33:54p Shadowfire says, "You lose subclass at below ~1400 or so ranks"
4/30/25 4:33:58p Warawonda says, "do that eather"
4/30/25 4:34:00p Shadowfire says, "but you remain a fighter"
4/30/25 4:34:20p Warawonda says, "should just stop you from untraining til 3rd"
4/30/25 4:34:32p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
4/30/25 4:34:38p Fortuna has fallen to a Toisicle.
4/30/25 4:34:42p Shadowfire says, "I mainly just want people to understand /why/ we complain"
4/30/25 4:34:43p Shadowmutt sniffs the air.
4/30/25 4:34:55p Lady Dragon says, "i dont complain =P"
4/30/25 4:34:59p Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
4/30/25 4:35:01p Lady Dragon says, "hehe"
4/30/25 4:35:03p Fortuna is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:35:10p Shadowfire says, "With all due respect, Haffron, Gorvin, and I hunt vastly more than you"
4/30/25 4:35:10p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:35:17p Warawonda says, "i mean need to open soruce this game at this point i dont think the GM have the time to fix this"
4/30/25 4:35:30p Warawonda says, "things*"
4/30/25 4:35:59p Lady Dragon says, "i watch art studying lasties in bookfort stressing out about qualifying and im like... no thanks i have a life"
4/30/25 4:36:02p Shadowfire says, "But yeah I have made some proposals about a champion rework"
4/30/25 4:36:12p Shadowfire says, "I'm quite pleased with my latest one"
4/30/25 4:36:44p Warawonda says, "i dont think that should change"
4/30/25 4:36:46p Lady Dragon says, "rangers can keep their 2k lasties"
4/30/25 4:37:05p Shadowfire says, "I see lasties as a positive"
4/30/25 4:37:18p Shadowfire says, "It's meaningful progression without requiring ranks"
4/30/25 4:37:18p Warawonda says, "forces people to come out and hunt"
4/30/25 4:37:24p Warawonda says, "as well"
4/30/25 4:37:39p Warawonda says, "gives them goals"
4/30/25 4:37:40p Lady Dragon says, "yes but it binds you to one area"
4/30/25 4:37:44p Shadowfire says, "eh"
4/30/25 4:37:49p Shadowfire says, "You can study more or less the entire world"
4/30/25 4:37:58p Shadowfire says, "With about 1200 Duvin total"
4/30/25 4:38:05p Shadowfire says, "About 850 if you have 1000 goss"
4/30/25 4:38:18p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:38:29p Shadowfire asks, "but is being bound to an area a problem?"
4/30/25 4:38:37p Shadowfire says, "We hunt the same 4-5 areas quite consistently"
4/30/25 4:38:43p Shadowfire says, "So it's not really a meaningful downside"
4/30/25 4:38:45p Lady Dragon says, "yes but i like exploring other places... we havent done a good gowe hunt in a while cuz ppl dont have lasties there"
4/30/25 4:38:49p Shadowfire says, "And goss just... works"
4/30/25 4:39:05p Shadowfire says, "We can't train ranks or train our clicker skill to mitigate or eliminate fell's downsides"
4/30/25 4:39:10p Warawonda says, "unlike the fail blade"
4/30/25 4:39:17p Shadowfire says, "It will just always be RNGblade"
4/30/25 4:39:33p Warawonda says, "ranager is the most balance subclass"
4/30/25 4:39:36p Deathless is no longer Clanning.

4/30/25 4:39:45p Fortuna has fallen to an Ice'kin.
4/30/25 4:39:55p Reisa is no longer Clanning.
4/30/25 4:39:58p Shadowfire says, "People think my complaining means I think rangers should be nerfed, but I would never want that"
4/30/25 4:40:06p Crius yells, "It’s Noon on Merdi, the 63rd day of Spring in the 641st year of the Ascendancy, and all’s well."
4/30/25 4:40:08p Shadowfire says, "I just want champions to be more fun and equal"

4/30/25 4:40:11p Crius yells, "Fortuna is fallen in the Eastern Mountains. Healer needed."
4/30/25 4:40:19p Fortuna is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:40:25p Nuckin Futz is no longer Clanning.
4/30/25 4:40:32p You concentrate on sending your message to Fortuna.
4/30/25 4:40:32p You think to Fortuna, "you need help?"
4/30/25 4:40:34p Lady Dragon says, "im not disagreeing with you...i love the new charge feature"
4/30/25 4:40:38p Blaque Smith is now Clanning.
4/30/25 4:40:44p Fortuna thinks to you, "hunting foggy, you're welcome to come by"
4/30/25 4:40:46p Shadowfire says, "Charge is useful"
4/30/25 4:40:56p Shadowfire says, "But it doesn't really deliver on most of what it tried to"
4/30/25 4:40:58p You concentrate on sending your message to Fortuna.
4/30/25 4:40:58p You think to Fortuna, "Crius yells, "Fortuna is fallen in the Eastern Mountains. Healer needed.""
4/30/25 4:41:09p Fortuna thinks to you, "lol i fell for like 2 seconds"
4/30/25 4:41:20p Shadowfire says, "The "pull exile" is meant to be a rescue thing but it's basically impossible to pull off"
4/30/25 4:41:21p Lady Dragon says, "i dunno... depends on what the goal was"
4/30/25 4:41:26p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:41:38p Shadowfire says, "the "charge through stuff" doesn't work unless you're stationary or running away from things"
4/30/25 4:41:45p Blaque Smith is no longer Clanning.
4/30/25 4:41:45p Warawonda says, "i think was becuase of the pathing"
4/30/25 4:41:46p Azerak is now Clanning.
4/30/25 4:41:47p Lady Dragon says, "not true"
4/30/25 4:41:55p Shadowfire asks, "Oh?"
4/30/25 4:42:00p Lady Dragon says, "i can charge while moving"
4/30/25 4:42:01p Bashak is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:42:07p Lady Dragon says, "threw things"
4/30/25 4:42:09p Shadowfire says, "I've tested this quite extensively and wrote a macro to execute it frame-perfectly"
4/30/25 4:42:30p Shadowfire says, "As I said it works if you're running away"
4/30/25 4:42:33p Lady Dragon says, "you have to unclick the curser to make it not hit a mob. thats all"
4/30/25 4:42:40p Shadowfire says, "But if you're running /toward/ something"
4/30/25 4:42:46p Kahn St'ple nods and smiles at Warawonda.
4/30/25 4:42:51p Shadowfire says, "your momentum will carry you into a swing most of the time"
4/30/25 4:42:56p Warawonda ponders, "/move stop"
4/30/25 4:43:03p Warawonda says, "then use the command"
4/30/25 4:43:04p Shadowfire says, "Ah but you see"
4/30/25 4:43:06p Shadowfire says, "If you do that"
4/30/25 4:43:11p Warawonda says, "you die"
4/30/25 4:43:15p Warawonda says, "i know"
4/30/25 4:43:19p Shadowfire says, "It bugs out and you try to pull yourself"
4/30/25 4:43:27p Warawonda says, "oh"
4/30/25 4:43:34p Shadowfire says, "Yes, as I said, I tested it extensively"
4/30/25 4:43:47p Warawonda says, "what happend if you say move a direction and do it"
4/30/25 4:43:50p Shadowfire says, "I spent close to an hour in south forest charging around"
4/30/25 4:44:09p Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
4/30/25 4:44:10p Fortuna has fallen to a Frost Yorilla.
4/30/25 4:44:13p Shadowfire says, "Hmm"
4/30/25 4:44:17p Fortuna is no longer fallen.
4/30/25 4:44:20p Shadowfire says, "Part of the issue is the small screen"
4/30/25 4:44:34p Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
4/30/25 4:44:35p Shadowfire says, "For it to work in the "charge through stuff" you need to be able to target behind the mobs"
4/30/25 4:44:36p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:44:43p Lady Dragon says, "this is true"
4/30/25 4:44:52p Shadowfire says, "But you also need something like 1/2 a screen of distance for it to kick in"
4/30/25 4:44:54p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
4/30/25 4:45:02p Sentinel yells, "There is only one punishment for treason."
4/30/25 4:45:07p Shadowfire says, "If you don't have that it defaults to forcing you into a swing loop"
4/30/25 4:45:16p Kahn St'ple nods and smiles at Lady Dragon.
4/30/25 4:45:23p Shadowfire says, "And using the command doesn't break the swing loop"
4/30/25 4:45:23p Shadowmutt sniffs the air.
4/30/25 4:45:28p Dinsdale is now Clanning.
4/30/25 4:45:29p Shadowfire says, "As swinging takes priority over commands"
4/30/25 4:45:39p Shadowfire says, "So you can't spam the charge button and hope it goes off"
4/30/25 4:45:48p Shadowfire says, "You have to stop in place for a few frames"
4/30/25 4:45:53p Shadowfire says, "THEN go"
4/30/25 4:46:12p Shadowfire says, "No shade on Slarty, it works pretty damned well overall"
4/30/25 4:46:32p Shadowfire says, "But only for repositioning/catch-up and going anti-bee AMRAAM"
4/30/25 4:47:09p Lady Dragon says, "or if you are surrounded while stoned you can escape"
4/30/25 4:47:23p Shadowfire says, "Indeed so"
4/30/25 4:47:30p Shadowfire says, "But only if you're running away from the mobs"
4/30/25 4:47:32p Shadowfire says, "Or stationary"
4/30/25 4:47:45p You have 6620 coins.
4/30/25 4:47:50p Shadowfire says, "I do think that would be easily resolved by putting the action on a shield instead of a weapon"
4/30/25 4:48:12p Lady Dragon says, "maybe both"
4/30/25 4:48:19p Shadowfire says, "The frames of delay in macro execution force a ~2-3 frame window of vulnerability"
4/30/25 4:48:27p Shadowfire says, "where if you run into something you'll swing"
4/30/25 4:48:36p Shadowmutt scratches itself.
4/30/25 4:48:59p Lady Dragon says, "i think the only real change needed would be charging while having a chain on"
4/30/25 4:49:05p Shadowfire says, "yeah"
4/30/25 4:49:22p Shadowfire says, "My feedback was basically"

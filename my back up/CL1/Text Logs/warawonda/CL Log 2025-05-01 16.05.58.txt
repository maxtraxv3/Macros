5/1/25 4:28:00p Kahn St'ple says, "Greetings, Lord Catan."
5/1/25 4:28:00p Shadowfire says, "Which is a DPS boost for bloodmages"
5/1/25 4:28:06p Shadowfire says, "Since they don't need the Atkus"
5/1/25 4:28:17p Warawonda says, "has anyone dont the 3000 under"
5/1/25 4:28:20p Catan asks, "negative atkus?"
5/1/25 4:28:21p Warawonda says, "done*"
5/1/25 4:28:23p Shadowfire says, "Yeah"
5/1/25 4:28:29p Warawonda says, "might over flow"
5/1/25 4:28:31p Shadowfire says, "So on the backend of the game"
5/1/25 4:28:38p Shadowfire says, "when you gain a rank"
5/1/25 4:28:48p Shadowfire says, "It doesn't save, "Character A gained 1 rank of Atkus""
5/1/25 4:28:58p Shadowfire says, "It increases your stats by some amount based on the trainer"
5/1/25 4:29:11p Warawonda says, "+16"
5/1/25 4:29:17p Shadowfire says, "Becuase of this, if you train a trainer that gives negative stats"
5/1/25 4:29:23p Shadowfire says, "That stat can go negative"
5/1/25 4:29:46p Warawonda says, "+16 to accurcy per rank of atkus"
5/1/25 4:29:49p Shadowfire says, "And there isn't any code that says, "hey you don't have any more of this to lose, you can't keep training more""
5/1/25 4:30:06p Shadowfire says, "so Anglisa is really, really strong for bloodmages"
5/1/25 4:30:19p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
5/1/25 4:30:28p Catan asks, "Angilsa?"
5/1/25 4:30:32p Shadowfire says, "Anglisa is basically"
5/1/25 4:30:34p Warawonda says, "ive already planed to make a fast swingin blood mage"
5/1/25 4:30:36p Shadowfire says, "-1 Evus +2 Regia per rank"
5/1/25 4:30:45p Warawonda says, "just checking numbers with freinds"
5/1/25 4:31:00p You have 6505 coins.
5/1/25 4:31:02p Catan asks, "-1 evus means what in terms of fighting abilities?"
5/1/25 4:31:15p Warawonda says, "you lose 1 eveus rank"
5/1/25 4:31:42p Catan asks, "you lose all the atkus, balthus, regia, histia associated with it?"
5/1/25 4:31:51p Shadowfire says, "Well so for example"
5/1/25 4:31:52p Warawonda says, "those trainer your ment to train back the evus loss"
5/1/25 4:32:06p Shadowfire says, "Let's say you gain 1 rank of Balthus"
5/1/25 4:32:20p Shadowfire says, "It doesn't store, "Catan has 400 ranks of Balthus""
5/1/25 4:32:34p Shadowfire says, "It stores, "Catan has X units of Balance""
5/1/25 4:32:48p Catan says, "ok"
5/1/25 4:32:52p Shadowfire says, "And if you are training Balthus, when you gain a rank, you gain +balance to your stats"
5/1/25 4:33:15p Shadowfire says, "Evus gives you 1/4 of an Atkus of accuracy per rank"
5/1/25 4:33:32p Shadowfire says, "So -1 Evus is basically -0.25 Atkus worth of accuracy"
5/1/25 4:33:42p Shadowfire says, "So when gain a rank of Anglisa"
5/1/25 4:33:56p Shadowfire says, "you 'gain' -0.25 Atkus worth of accuracy"
5/1/25 4:34:09p You have 6505 coins.
5/1/25 4:34:20p Shadowfire says, "But since bloodblade gives such bananas offense"
5/1/25 4:34:29p Shadowfire says, "bloodmages never really need all of the accuracy bloodblade givesthem"
5/1/25 4:34:39p Shadowfire says, "So losing accuracy is actually a net positive"
5/1/25 4:34:45p Shadowfire says, "Because accuracy has a high balance cost per swing"
5/1/25 4:34:59p Shadowfire ponders, "back in a bit, watching a John Oliver thing with my wife"
5/1/25 4:35:11p Warawonda says, "you basicly pay 2 ranks per rank becuase it take a rank of evus when you rank with them"
5/1/25 4:35:30p Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"

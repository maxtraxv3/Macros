5/4/25 3:05:36a Brooke Britney says, "It's fine. Donations have been generous. We probably won't need a new levy."
5/4/25 3:05:37a Seaforth says, "I don't think the water is coming from the roof."
5/4/25 3:05:38a Garr says, "You should hire more zo like Unk"
5/4/25 3:05:50a Garr says, "He did a great job digging on Tenebrion's Island"
5/4/25 3:05:53a Phroon asks, "Can one dig a new roof?"

5/4/25 3:06:18a Shobaffum says, "i dig new roofs they are awesome"
5/4/25 3:06:19a Brooke Britney asks, "And what do you think, Titus Kojiro DeLouche St. Thoomignon, Lord Seaforth, Imperial Navy Commander in absentia, the Bolt-Scarred, Organicus, etc etc?"
5/4/25 3:06:26a (Phroon nods to Shobaffum)

5/4/25 3:06:45a Warawonda asks, "whats this new roof going look like?"
5/4/25 3:06:52a Brooke Britney says, "Waterproof. We can hope."
5/4/25 3:06:58a Brooke Britney yells, "If it's not too much trouble."
5/4/25 3:07:00a Seaforth says, "Brooke Britney, I think your incompetent Dwarves have introduced water from BENEATH the Temple"
5/4/25 3:07:01a Warawonda ponders, "hope?"
5/4/25 3:07:06a Garr asks, "Can we equip it with ballistas to shoot rats?"

5/4/25 3:07:14a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:07:19a Kevas asks, "So, I may not be a structural engineer, but shouldn't we be more worried about the foundation than the roof?"
5/4/25 3:07:23a Brooke Britney asks, "Now there's an idea. A tower in town center?"
5/4/25 3:07:24a Shobaffum says, "Garr that is the best idea ever"
5/4/25 3:07:31a Inu Teisei ponders, "dancing for irritation's sake, check"
5/4/25 3:07:44a Brooke Britney asks, "Are there any wizards among you to staff the tower?"
5/4/25 3:07:55a Seaforth says, "Well done on remembering my full title, though. Bravo."
5/4/25 3:07:59a (Phroon looks around.)

5/4/25 3:08:24a Dandelion says, "Is Malky a Wizard? I tought 'e was an imp"
5/4/25 3:08:25a Phroon says, "I mean… we have a catapult. Not that it's all that useful either."
5/4/25 3:08:25a Brooke Britney says, "Yes, perhaps we should be concerned about the foundation. Treating the cause as well as the symptoms, eh? You should be a chirurgeon."
5/4/25 3:08:26a Crunch asks, "Or Geraldus?"
5/4/25 3:08:29a Garr says, "Didn't we liberate a lightning tower or something from Tenebrions? Or was that for our rainbow cannon? I can't remember anymore"
5/4/25 3:08:31a Brooke Britney says, "You should be a chirurgeon."
5/4/25 3:08:44a Kevas says, "Healing is my metier, yes."
5/4/25 3:08:55a Cecil says, "we can fling a mystic up there with a catapult"

5/4/25 3:09:09a (Warawonda hides)
5/4/25 3:09:09a (Brooke Britney sketches down ideas.)
5/4/25 3:09:19a Inu Teisei asks, "Can we get a rainbow covering on the roof?"
5/4/25 3:09:21a Brooke Britney ponders, "New tower… catapult in east town… fling mystic to new tower."
5/4/25 3:09:21a Squib ponders, "Where's my rainbow??"
5/4/25 3:09:26a Julia is no longer Clanning.
5/4/25 3:09:28a Seaforth says, "Garr, in order to comprehend rainbow lightning towers, it is necessary to take more drugs. Trust me."
5/4/25 3:09:29a (Squib looks around sadly)

5/4/25 3:09:51a Inu Teisei ponders, "no you don't it's called IMAGINATION!"
5/4/25 3:09:53a Brooke Britney yells, "Lithia! Send some of your dwarves to shore up the temple foundation."
5/4/25 3:10:13a Ravenstorm says, "hopefully they are up to the task"
5/4/25 3:10:14a Brooke Britney asks, "Has anyone seen LittlePrince?"
5/4/25 3:10:18a Seaforth says, "I'm just going with what Capt. Stinkfist told me"
5/4/25 3:10:23a Garr says, "As long as there aren't any holes that drop non-mystics into that underground lake I'll be happy"
5/4/25 3:10:25a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:10:32a Warawonda ponders, "!"
5/4/25 3:10:32a Dandelion says, "I tink he is busy wit his wife"
5/4/25 3:10:48a (Brooke Britney looks disappointed.)
5/4/25 3:10:48a Cecil asks, "we can fill the holes with mystcis?"
5/4/25 3:10:51a Ravenstorm says, "LittlePrince has been around but he currently is not on Brooke..sorry"
5/4/25 3:10:55a Brooke Britney says, "So, fountains."
5/4/25 3:11:01a (Warawonda nods)
5/4/25 3:11:04a Dandelion asks, "Plural?"
5/4/25 3:11:04a Seaforth says, "So,"
5/4/25 3:11:07a Yigdal says, "I'm collecting crystals for Lithia Akka's fountain."
5/4/25 3:11:08a Yigdal ponders, "She has such grandiose plans."
5/4/25 3:11:08a Yigdal says, "I still need some selenite crystals."
5/4/25 3:11:09a Yigdal says, "I'm collecting crystals for Lithia Akka's fountain."
5/4/25 3:11:09a Yigdal ponders, "She has such grandiose plans."
5/4/25 3:11:25a (Brooke Britney flicks dust off her bodice.)
5/4/25 3:11:31a Seaforth says, "Fountains of WATER, to be clear. Not... blood, or rats, or anything like that."
5/4/25 3:11:44a Dandelion exclaims, "Bravo, Seafort!"
5/4/25 3:11:45a Brooke Britney says, "Yes. The purest, most sparkling water."
5/4/25 3:11:49a (Seaforth checks the contract)
5/4/25 3:11:50a Garr says, "I doubt you'd hear bloodmages complain about a blood fountain"
5/4/25 3:12:01a Inu Teisei ponders, "correction: Yes Dear."
5/4/25 3:12:08a Phroon asks, "And the selenite?"
5/4/25 3:12:14a (Brooke Britney compares the plans for the fountain of blood and the fountain of water, but puts one back in her bejeweled handbag.)
5/4/25 3:12:30a Inu Teisei asks, "do we get the blood?"
5/4/25 3:12:36a (Brooke Britney smiles sweetly.)
5/4/25 3:12:36a Dandelion whispers, "Selenite?"
5/4/25 3:12:38a (Garr looks up at the bejeweled handbag)
5/4/25 3:12:41a Garr ponders, "Shiny!"
5/4/25 3:12:42a (Inu Teisei rubs her grubby paws together)
5/4/25 3:12:44a Brooke Britney says, "We could still go for the blood."
5/4/25 3:12:49a Seaforth says, "NO"
5/4/25 3:12:55a Inu Teisei says, "c ome one"
5/4/25 3:12:55a Dandelion says, "Let's not"
5/4/25 3:12:56a Seaforth says, "Just water."
5/4/25 3:12:56a Inu Teisei says, "c ome on"
5/4/25 3:12:57a Warawonda ponders, "a healing fountain?"
5/4/25 3:13:00a Inu Teisei says, "imagine"
5/4/25 3:13:02a Brooke Britney ponders, "The imperious voice of command. Hard to resist."
5/4/25 3:13:03a Inu Teisei says, "BMs"
5/4/25 3:13:08a Inu Teisei says, "insta charged"
5/4/25 3:13:14a Brooke Britney says, "The stonemasons have been hard at work. The final shape is coming together."
5/4/25 3:13:18a Brooke Britney says, "There's just one little problem."
5/4/25 3:13:25a Inu Teisei says, "or just make it an alternate donation site for the blood pool"
5/4/25 3:13:25a Seaforth says, "No gouts, no geysers. Fountain."
5/4/25 3:13:27a (Phroon nods)
5/4/25 3:13:30a Warawonda asks, "?"
5/4/25 3:13:34a Seaforth says, "A moderate spray."
5/4/25 3:13:35a Kevas ponders, "only one? That's promising."
5/4/25 3:13:36a Dandelion whispers, "Ah! Tanks. Missed dat"
5/4/25 3:13:36a Warawonda asks, "whats the problem?"
5/4/25 3:13:38a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:13:41a Brooke Britney says, "Lithia wanted to make it, well, fancy."
5/4/25 3:13:47a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 3:13:50a Brooke Britney says, "Yigdal's been collecting some supplies, but even I have a few doubts."
5/4/25 3:13:53a Brooke Britney exclaims, "Nothing that cannot be overcome!"
5/4/25 3:14:00a Cecil says, "if only Stone-that-Walk was still around"
5/4/25 3:14:00a Garr says, "She should talk to MrFancypants about that then"
5/4/25 3:14:06a Brooke Britney says, "With the power of money (and a good authority figure like Lord Seaforth here), I'm sure we can accomplish anything."
5/4/25 3:14:28a Phroon says, "Money is Power, Power is Money. I mean, just look at Kalian."
5/4/25 3:14:32a Brooke Britney says, "Do any of you have experience talking to Hekus? He hasn't been answering my sunstone messages."
5/4/25 3:14:37a (Brooke Britney pouts.)
5/4/25 3:14:47a Warawonda asks, "should we go talk to him?"
5/4/25 3:14:48a Dandelion asks, "Yes, Hekus is a friend. Why?"
5/4/25 3:14:56a Seaforth exclaims, "Fanciness should be inherent in the quality of the work! Not from attaching baubles!"
5/4/25 3:14:58a Koppi yells, "Slyph reports: Love on! Act now, and my 16 visionstone series is yours for the low price of 20k."
5/4/25 3:15:00a Brooke Britney says, "I'm just not sure that what Lithia wants is even possible."
5/4/25 3:15:05a Phroon says, "He brushes us off quite a bit too, to be honest."
5/4/25 3:15:07a Garr says, "He's a jerk, he wont give me any moonstones to play with"
5/4/25 3:15:08a Inu Teisei says, "no all baubles"
5/4/25 3:15:11a Dinsdale is now Clanning.
5/4/25 3:15:13a Inu Teisei says, "no fake fanciness"
5/4/25 3:15:14a Dandelion says, "He tinks a lot"
5/4/25 3:15:17a Brooke Britney says, "Baubles can help one's inner fanciness radiate outward."
5/4/25 3:15:22a (Garr nods)
5/4/25 3:15:23a Inu Teisei says, "we want tons of jewels"
5/4/25 3:15:37a Brooke Britney says, "But yes, if you'd have a word with Hekus."
5/4/25 3:15:39a Kevas ponders, "extra radiation, noted."
5/4/25 3:15:40a Dandelion says, "Sparkles are nice"
5/4/25 3:15:41a Dinsdale is sharing experiences with you.
5/4/25 3:15:48a Warawonda asks, "should we go talk tohim now?"
5/4/25 3:15:53a Inu Teisei says, "what about different spots on the fountain when rubbed would imbue that gems power for a day"
5/4/25 3:15:55a Dandelion asks, "Whaddya want us to have a word about?"
5/4/25 3:15:56a Brooke Britney says, "As friends who are concerned that this fountain needs to be really impressive."
5/4/25 3:15:58a Seaforth ponders, "who is Hekus?"
5/4/25 3:16:01a Brooke Britney asks, "And … magical?"
5/4/25 3:16:04a Dandelion says, "Mm hmm"
5/4/25 3:16:04a Inu Teisei says, "yes"
5/4/25 3:16:05a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 3:16:21a You concentrate on sending your message to Seaforth.
5/4/25 3:16:21a You think to Seaforth, "the one you let you become a healer"
5/4/25 3:16:24a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar looks edgy but doesn't do anything.
5/4/25 3:16:28a Dandelion asks, "What? Now? Or 'ventually?"
5/4/25 3:16:29a Brooke Britney asks, "Well, are you all just going to stand there?"
5/4/25 3:16:31a (Phroon looks at the selenite crystal atop his asklepian staff.)
5/4/25 3:16:32a Renna is now Clanning.
5/4/25 3:16:33a Brooke Britney says, "It's a wonder anything gets done in this town."
5/4/25 3:16:34a Inu Teisei says, "yes"
5/4/25 3:16:37a Garr ponders, "The guy who makes you a healer Seaforth"
5/4/25 3:16:40a Brooke Britney says, "You'd think I had to carve the stone myself."
5/4/25 3:16:45a Renna is no longer Clanning.
5/4/25 3:16:53a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:16:56a Dandelion exclaims, "Heyers, Master Hekus!"
5/4/25 3:17:04a Master Hekus says, "Greetings, Lady Dandelion."
5/4/25 3:17:07a Garr reads a scroll.
5/4/25 3:17:13a Dandelion says, "Sorry t'innerupt yer tinkin'"
5/4/25 3:17:15a Master Hekus asks, "What's with the mob?"
5/4/25 3:17:15a Garr ponders, "hrm"
5/4/25 3:17:16a Seaforth asks, "what is this place?"
5/4/25 3:17:25a (Master Hekus notices Brooke.)
5/4/25 3:17:27a Dandelion says, "Well, Brooke here's doin' some town renos"
5/4/25 3:17:28a Master Hekus says, "Oh Gaia..."
5/4/25 3:17:33a Cecil asks, "has anyone ever noticed heres only a "Master?" Why is he giving us ANY advice??"
5/4/25 3:17:35a Master Hekus exclaims, "For the last time, it's not possible!"
5/4/25 3:17:39a Dandelion says, "An' she has someting special tought up"
5/4/25 3:17:44a Cecil asks, "why is he not Lord Hekus?"
5/4/25 3:17:46a Brooke Britney says, "I think we got off on the wrong foot."
5/4/25 3:17:47a Master Hekus says, "First, you'd need an inordinate amount of selenite."
5/4/25 3:17:55a Brooke Britney exclaims, "The selenite is being collected!"
5/4/25 3:17:56a Master Hekus asks, "And second, how are you going to keep it supplied with blood?"
5/4/25 3:17:57a Crunch says, "I don't think he's ever given anyone a training ledger"
5/4/25 3:18:04a Dandelion says, "We're purdy good at inordinate"
5/4/25 3:18:06a Kalian says, "I've been collecting that much"
5/4/25 3:18:06a Master Hekus exclaims, "I don't want to think about it!"
5/4/25 3:18:08a Inu Teisei ponders, "LA members?"
5/4/25 3:18:10a Brooke Britney says, "Blood, yes! Well, there's lots of that."
5/4/25 3:18:14a Seaforth exclaims, "wait - no! No blood!"
5/4/25 3:18:20a Brooke Britney says, "But they're thinking of perhaps going with the second option."
5/4/25 3:18:22a Seaforth says, "Hold up."
5/4/25 3:18:28a Inu Teisei says, "everyone chant blood blood blood"
5/4/25 3:18:29a Warawonda ponders, "connected to the blood pool"
5/4/25 3:18:31a Master Hekus asks, "You want to use *water*?"
5/4/25 3:18:34a (Dandelion nods)
5/4/25 3:18:37a Dandelion says, "Yes, please"
5/4/25 3:18:39a Phroon says, "Yes please."
5/4/25 3:18:39a (Brooke Britney shrugs delicately.)
5/4/25 3:18:41a Master Hekus exclaims, "That's even more impossible than blood!"
5/4/25 3:18:42a Inu Teisei says, "yes connected to blood pool"
5/4/25 3:18:49a Inu Teisei says, "as a deposit box"
5/4/25 3:18:54a Dandelion asks, "Do you really mean impossible?"
5/4/25 3:19:02a Warawonda asks, "what would be possiable?"
5/4/25 3:19:03a Phroon asks, "Or just really difficult?"
5/4/25 3:19:03a Brooke Britney says, "But if you were going to try it,"
5/4/25 3:19:06a Dandelion asks, "To difficult an' bovversome?"
5/4/25 3:19:07a Master Hekus says, "Improbable, at best."
5/4/25 3:19:18a Brooke Britney says, "Improbable is good."
5/4/25 3:19:18a Crunch asks, "Don't you have a water fountain inside the temple somewhere?"
5/4/25 3:19:21a Dandelion exclaims, "But tink about how pretty it would be!"
5/4/25 3:19:23a Garr exclaims, "Maybe we can collect enough water from the shadowspring source? That might have some extra healing properties to help the fountain be great!"
5/4/25 3:19:24a Warawonda asks, "how would you do it?"
5/4/25 3:19:28a Noivad is now Clanning.
5/4/25 3:19:31a Inu Teisei ponders, "what we needs is a LA™ Architect"
5/4/25 3:19:31a Kevas says, "Ah, well, that's a different chest of fish entirely."
5/4/25 3:19:35a Kevas asks, "But is it wise?"
5/4/25 3:19:44a Seaforth says, "We live on an island that is constantly covered in puddles of water."
5/4/25 3:19:57a Master Hekus says, "You can't just use one source."
5/4/25 3:19:59a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:20:01a (Inu Teisei perks up her ears at the readinf of shadow)
5/4/25 3:20:06a (Inu Teisei perks up her ears at the reading of shadow)
5/4/25 3:20:08a Brooke Britney asks, "Do you mean it would be impossible to just use one?"
5/4/25 3:20:09a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar practices cackling.
5/4/25 3:20:14a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar sings Inu Teisei a song woven from shadows.
5/4/25 3:20:28a Master Hekus says, "Extremely impossible."
5/4/25 3:20:29a Warawonda ponders, "perhaps lugubrion know a way?"
5/4/25 3:20:43a Inu Teisei ponders, "ya brion's can solve anything"
5/4/25 3:20:44a Master Hekus says, "If you used at least 3 sources you could move it down to highly unlikely."
5/4/25 3:20:56a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 3:20:57a Master Hekus says, "And they'd have to be infused with moon energy."
5/4/25 3:21:03a Dandelion says, "It has been a while, but remember yer adventurous streak, Master Hekus? You love a challenge"
5/4/25 3:21:05a Brooke Britney asks, "Could you just infuse it yourself?"
5/4/25 3:21:12a Master Hekus exclaims, "I can't think of three sources that infused!"
5/4/25 3:21:17a Master Hekus says, "Infuse it my..."
5/4/25 3:21:18a Brooke Britney says, "Everyone knows you're on good terms with the Moon."
5/4/25 3:21:19a Inu Teisei says, "sunstones"
5/4/25 3:21:23a Crunch ponders, "Is this guy a healer, or a mason?"
5/4/25 3:21:25a Master Hekus asks, "What do you think we're doing here, exactly!?"
5/4/25 3:21:30a Haffron is now Clanning.
5/4/25 3:21:30a (Dandelion smiles)
5/4/25 3:21:33a Brooke Britney says, "I'm not clear on that point."
5/4/25 3:21:35a Seaforth says, "I have flogged many builders in my time, and this man does not look like a builder."
5/4/25 3:21:40a Master Hekus says, "You want a self-sustaining healing enhancing fountain in the middle of town."
5/4/25 3:21:51a Brooke Britney asks, "Wow, do you think we can do all that?"
5/4/25 3:21:52a Inu Teisei says, "with a comm node attached"
5/4/25 3:21:56a Dandelion exclaims, "Wouldn't it be lovely!"
5/4/25 3:22:03a Master Hekus exclaims, "You'd need 10 healers constantlty working to keep that infused if you used plain water!"
5/4/25 3:22:04a Garr thinks, "Lore Tour is in the healer hall for anyone late"
5/4/25 3:22:05a Inu Teisei says, "so pretty sungems"
5/4/25 3:22:15a Dandelion asks, "CAn we find some fancy water t'use?"
5/4/25 3:22:22a Crunch asks, "Fewer healers if it were blood, eh?"
5/4/25 3:22:22a Cecil says, "Connie would like a fountain that spouts beer"
5/4/25 3:22:29a Garr exclaims, "Shadowspring water. That stuff already has properties to help with growth of life!"
5/4/25 3:22:32a Master Hekus exclaims, "Oh much fewer. Blood simplifies it greatly!"
5/4/25 3:22:34a Warawonda asks, "what if we super charged moonstone using ethrial power?"
5/4/25 3:22:34a (Seaforth despairs)
5/4/25 3:22:35a Ravenstorm asks, "so who do we need to kill to get what we need?"
5/4/25 3:22:35a Shadowfire ponders, "What if we used some kind of focusing crystals?"
5/4/25 3:22:39a Haffron says, "I heard that Hekus likes Moonshine..."
5/4/25 3:22:39a Master Hekus says, "But it's still impossible."
5/4/25 3:22:47a Kevas ponders, "Healing with blood seems counterproductive"
5/4/25 3:22:50a Brooke Britney asks, "Could we combine the two plans? A little bit of blood in the water?"
5/4/25 3:22:55a Dandelion says, "Ick"
5/4/25 3:22:58a (Phroon frowns)
5/4/25 3:22:59a Katreesa says, "blood and fire...."
5/4/25 3:23:03a Seaforth says, "Lord Ravenstorm asking the important questions."
5/4/25 3:23:06a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:23:14a (Katreesa sings a little tune to herself)
5/4/25 3:23:16a Noivad growls, "sounds like a bad time"
5/4/25 3:23:17a Inu Teisei thinks, "what if we's gots Master Hekus drunk on Moonshine?"
5/4/25 3:23:33a Brooke Britney asks, "So you need them to bring barrels of this moon-infused water back to town?"
5/4/25 3:23:43a Master Hekus says, "Well first you'd have to find it. Yes."
5/4/25 3:23:45a Brooke Britney says, "Shadowspring sounds icky."
5/4/25 3:23:48a Inu Teisei thinks, "then Hekus will stop wearing wah wah glasses and be like OKAY!"
5/4/25 3:24:00a Seaforth asks, "And we have to kill someone, I suppose?"
5/4/25 3:24:04a Phroon says, "I've got a barrel of Shadowspring water rattling around in storage that I've been saving just in case."
5/4/25 3:24:10a Inu Teisei ponders, "Brooke where's your sense of adventure?"
5/4/25 3:24:10a Brooke Britney exclaims, "Ah, splendid!"
5/4/25 3:24:12a Garr exclaims, "We don't have to go inside! they didn't have a builder like you Brooke so it's already leaking out the side!"
5/4/25 3:24:21a Ravenstorm pulls a bowl of spicy blephat wing soup out of his lunchbox, and chews it with evident pleasure.
5/4/25 3:24:23a Dandelion says, "Dere's nice water inna mushump hut. Makes nice potions"
5/4/25 3:24:23a Brooke Britney asks, "Are there any other places aligned with the moon?"
5/4/25 3:24:31a Phroon says, "Could at least check it out, see if it's what we need or not."
5/4/25 3:24:37a Brooke Britney says, "Surely."
5/4/25 3:24:41a Ravenstorm says, "hmm"
5/4/25 3:24:41a Master Hekus says, "I suppose I could look at it."
5/4/25 3:24:42a Garr says, "The waterfall might have some good water"
5/4/25 3:24:43a (Master Hekus sighs.)
5/4/25 3:24:45a Ravenstorm says, "KI is but KI is rough"
5/4/25 3:24:46a (Brooke Britney nods.)
5/4/25 3:24:48a (Dandelion smiles)
5/4/25 3:24:49a (Phroon goes to talk to the storage dwarves.)
5/4/25 3:24:52a Master Hekus ponders, "If it'll get these people out of here faster."
5/4/25 3:24:54a (Brooke Britney consults her notes from Lithia.)
5/4/25 3:25:02a Dandelion exclaims, "It's time you got some freish air anyway!"
5/4/25 3:25:03a Brooke Britney asks, "There may be a couple waterfalls that qualify for that statement, yes?"
5/4/25 3:25:13a (Garr nods)
5/4/25 3:25:13a Seaforth says, "There is a lovely hot tub in the fighter hall. Lion-O gets all of his potion water there."
5/4/25 3:25:17a Dandelion says, "C'mon! It'll be fun"
5/4/25 3:25:26a Noivad growls, "ya master H you are always in here, you need vitamin d"
5/4/25 3:25:26a Brooke Britney says, "I've never been invited to one of the fighter hot tub parties."
5/4/25 3:25:31a Brooke Britney asks, "Can anyone score me an invitation?"
5/4/25 3:25:46a Seaforth says, "Not if you get blood in the tub"
5/4/25 3:26:01a Brooke Britney says, "You're fighters, I'm quite certain there is already blood in the tub."
5/4/25 3:26:09a Brooke Britney says, "I'm sorry no one told you."
5/4/25 3:26:14a Master Hekus says, "You're wasting your time though (and more importantly mine)."
5/4/25 3:26:14a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 3:26:32a Brooke Britney says, "Between you and me, Hekky, they're not exactly efficient builders."
5/4/25 3:26:34a Master Hekus says, "There is no way the water could keep an infusion long enough, even if you could collect enough barrels."
5/4/25 3:26:41a Phroon shows his barrel of water to everyone.
5/4/25 3:26:48a Shadowfire asks, "What about some kind of... resonant amplifier?"
5/4/25 3:26:48a Phroon fills his bottle with water from his barrel.
5/4/25 3:26:50a Ravenstorm says, "one step at a time"
5/4/25 3:26:50a Garr asks, "I was thinking about the one in the eastern mountains, but the one coming out from Sarra may have some beneficial properties. Have you seen the size of that Plesio'don?"
5/4/25 3:26:54a Haffron asks, "Does the water at Shadowspring Citadel have much potential?"
5/4/25 3:26:56a (Master Hekus takes a look.)
5/4/25 3:27:09a (Phroon offers Hekus the bottle of shadowspring water)
5/4/25 3:27:09a Master Hekus ponders, "huh! That's potent stuff."
5/4/25 3:27:09a Jeepers is now Clanning.
5/4/25 3:27:12a Haffron ponders, "phroon probably still has a bottle"

5/4/25 3:28:07a Master Hekus says, "Well... if that's true. And I doubt it is."
5/4/25 3:28:09a Haffron ponders, "Could mix some of Garr's gems in it... we should grind those up."
5/4/25 3:28:11a Master Hekus says, "This insane plan may work."
5/4/25 3:28:12a Dandelion exclaims, "It is!"
5/4/25 3:28:19a Brooke Britney says, "Now you're getting their hopes up."
5/4/25 3:28:20a Master Hekus says, "If you could get enough barrels, from enough different sources."
5/4/25 3:28:33a Kevas ponders, "insane we can do. That's a speciality."

5/4/25 3:28:39a Brooke Britney asks, "Sources aligned with the Moon?"
5/4/25 3:28:43a Shadowfire ponders, "What if we used selenite crystals in the pipe linings or the pool tiling?"
5/4/25 3:28:45a Master Hekus says, "You're going to need so much selenite."
5/4/25 3:28:55a (Phroon nods.)

5/4/25 3:29:13a Brooke Britney asks, "Would the ancient machines be a good clue for where to gather this moon-infused water?"
5/4/25 3:29:16a Master Hekus says, "It has maybe a 5% chance of working."
5/4/25 3:29:18a Ravenstorm says, "what about the watersource by the selenite spawn spot on metz"
5/4/25 3:29:20a Brooke Britney says, "I'll handle the paperwork, Hekus."

5/4/25 3:30:53a Master Hekus says, "Adventure? I'm much too experienced for that."
5/4/25 3:31:07a Inu Teisei ponders, "so old and feeble, check"

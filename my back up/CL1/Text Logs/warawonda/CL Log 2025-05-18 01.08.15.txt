5/18/25 3:21:43a Eli says, "yes"
5/18/25 3:21:43a Seaforth ponders, "Good question"

5/18/25 3:21:53a Egremora ponders, "Who's tellin' a story matters as much as the story inside."

5/18/25 3:21:56a Eli raises her jar of moonshine on high, and drains it in one gulp.
5/18/25 3:21:57a Griagh says, "Hmp, thanks fer wastin’ my time."
5/18/25 3:22:01a Coriakin says, "You'd have to ask someone else about shadow rumours. I try to stay away from that"
5/18/25 3:22:06a (Valadorei nods at Egremora)
5/18/25 3:22:07a Cecil says, "Eli just got taller falling down"
5/18/25 3:22:12a Egremora says, "I've heard that about you."
5/18/25 3:22:13a You equip your darkstone named “old”.
5/18/25 3:22:23a (Coriakin blinks)
5/18/25 3:22:27a Eli raises her jar of moonshine on high, and drains it in one gulp.

5/18/25 3:22:37a Palmeri says, "oh well who have YOU heard that from"
5/18/25 3:22:38a You slip your darkstone into your backpack.
5/18/25 3:22:41a Coriakin says, "Anyway...."
5/18/25 3:22:44a Eli raises her jar of moonshine on high, and drains it in one gulp.

5/18/25 3:23:19a (Seaforth blames Biro)
5/18/25 3:23:21a Coriakin says, "In fact, the Agronox seal did seem to be continuing to block the rend between planes"
5/18/25 3:23:26a Thoomilicious says, "cori's harp killed fewer people than last year"
5/18/25 3:23:34a Aurian ponders, "maybe"
5/18/25 3:23:41a Griagh says, "Aurian, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."

5/18/25 3:23:46a Griagh asks, "I’ll sell you a cup of high mountain tea for 5 coins. Okay with you?"
5/18/25 3:23:46a Coriakin says, "However, on the way down we were beset by horrible creatures, the likes of which had never been seen before"
5/18/25 3:23:48a Aurelie says, "Hmm"
5/18/25 3:23:49a Aurian says, "yes"

5/18/25 3:24:04a (Thistle shudders)
5/18/25 3:24:08a Garr ponders, "We've seen them before, but not in suce great numbers"
5/18/25 3:24:10a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:24:13a Coriakin says, "I hardly know how to describe them. Four legs, no head...."
5/18/25 3:24:23a Cecil asks, "you ok now, Eli?"
5/18/25 3:24:23a You gave signed good karma to Phroon, :).
5/18/25 3:24:26a Biro ponders, "we've seen them before, but not quite as varied!"
5/18/25 3:24:29a Slyph exclaims, "they're horrid!"
5/18/25 3:24:31a Coriakin says, "A pale colour like dry sand. Or a corpse."
5/18/25 3:24:41a (Palmeri shudders)
5/18/25 3:24:42a Slyph says, "think of vagil's socks, but... skitterling"

5/18/25 3:24:49a Thistle says, "I tought dey looked metal"
5/18/25 3:24:54a Palmeri says, "Pale makes me think of no blood, and THATS scary"
5/18/25 3:24:54a Cecil says, "you spelled color wrong Cori"
5/18/25 3:25:00a (Egremora shudders involuntarily.)
5/18/25 3:25:02a Biro ponders, "origami spiders"
5/18/25 3:25:02a Coriakin says, "Vicious and vile and violent"
5/18/25 3:25:11a (Mr Pudding would rather not)
5/18/25 3:25:11a Egremora says, "Moon bless me, I'm glad I never saw anything like that in our adventuring days."
5/18/25 3:25:12a Seaforth says, "Tetrapodal, but with no heads. Like a caltrops made of pale, rubbery flesh."
5/18/25 3:25:15a (Coriakin nods)
5/18/25 3:25:18a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:25:25a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 3:25:37a Coriakin says, "There seemed to be several varieties, but I couldn't tell you what the difference was between them"
5/18/25 3:25:39a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."
5/18/25 3:25:39a Ha'ri Farsight says, "Come back later when I'm more ready for help."
5/18/25 3:25:43a Slyph yells, "br fight!"
5/18/25 3:25:44a • You hear Aurelie's music...
5/18/25 3:25:44a Aurelie starts playing her starbuck harp.
5/18/25 3:25:44a (Aurelie): I see the Meadow!
5/18/25 3:25:45a Mr Pudding ponders, "just another bird in the house"
5/18/25 3:25:48a Coriakin says, "All I can tell you is that they were all dangerous"
5/18/25 3:25:49a Slyph says, "sorry."
5/18/25 3:25:55a Shadowfire ponders, "This bar is for the birds"
5/18/25 3:26:00a Coriakin says, "They seemed not of this plane, to me"
5/18/25 3:26:05a Cecil says, "it was trying to wet its beak"
5/18/25 3:26:19a Coriakin asks, "But from what our mystics said, they also didn't seem entirely reminiscent of the shadowplane's denizens?"
5/18/25 3:26:29a Griagh says, "Sativa, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 3:26:30a Griagh asks, "What’ll you have, Sativa?"
5/18/25 3:26:31a Sativa says, "shadow"
5/18/25 3:26:32a Griagh asks, "I’ll sell you a shadow Spit for 25 coins. Okay with you?"
5/18/25 3:26:32a (Coriakin looks to Phroon)

5/18/25 3:26:37a Griagh says, "Sativa, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 3:26:40a Seaforth says, "Unnatural shape. Unnatural movement."
5/18/25 3:26:44a (Coriakin nods back, relieved for the confirmation)
5/18/25 3:26:47a Cecil says, "the place needs a Bodygarred"
5/18/25 3:26:55a (Palmeri snorts)
5/18/25 3:27:03a Egremora says, "That's Mascarr's work, only you're doing it for him."
5/18/25 3:27:05a Clemence is now Clanning.
5/18/25 3:27:14a Coriakin says, "We barely managed to survive their onslaught, and eventually they retreated"
5/18/25 3:27:15a Sativa raises his mixed drink on high, and drains it in one gulp.
5/18/25 3:27:16a Phroon says, "The mystics said they did not seem touched by shadows, yes."
5/18/25 3:27:17a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:27:26a (Pe Ell claps)
5/18/25 3:27:27a Sativa says, "yup"

5/18/25 3:27:32a Sativa says, "shadow went down smooth"
5/18/25 3:27:33a Warawonda asks, "who?"
5/18/25 3:27:35a Griagh says, "Balangar, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 3:27:36a Griagh asks, "What’ll you have, Balangar?"
5/18/25 3:27:37a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:27:39a Kevas asks, "They seemed to respond to some kind of signal from... below?"
5/18/25 3:27:40a Balangar says, "mirror"
5/18/25 3:27:40a Griagh asks, "I’ll sell you a mirror Martyr for 15 coins. Okay with you?"
5/18/25 3:27:43a Balangar says, "yes"

5/18/25 3:27:47a Griagh says, "Hmp, thanks fer wastin’ my time."
5/18/25 3:27:47a Coriakin asks, "They seemed to be crawling deep underground. Perhaps along passages or conduits connecting the ancient sites?"
5/18/25 3:27:49a Egremora asks, "Signal? What kind of signal are we talkin'?"
5/18/25 3:27:57a Balangar raises his jar of moonshine on high, and drains it in one gulp.
5/18/25 3:28:00a Phroon says, "The mystics there also felt some sort of weave between them."
5/18/25 3:28:01a Griagh says, "Sativa, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 3:28:03a Sativa says, "dark"

5/18/25 3:28:22a Coriakin asks, "Some sort of tremor, Kevas? I thnk?"
5/18/25 3:28:25a Valadorei says, "Some sort of tie between them all."
5/18/25 3:28:29a Balangar says, "Hic."
5/18/25 3:28:37a (Phroon nods to Valadorei.)
5/18/25 3:28:38a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 3:28:38a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
5/18/25 3:28:38a (Coriakin): "Ruminating"
5/18/25 3:28:41a Egremora ponders, "This is reminding me of…"
5/18/25 3:28:44a Kevas says, "Maybe a sound? I don't recall with certainty"
5/18/25 3:28:58a Egremora asks, "Now, do you all know any stories of the Gates of the Moon?"
5/18/25 3:29:03a Kevas says, "Like a deep sound that was felt as much as heard."
5/18/25 3:29:06a Coriakin says, "Are there creatures that share a single mind? Other than Laughing Academy members, I mean"
5/18/25 3:29:07a Balangar says, "Hic."
5/18/25 3:29:13a Slyph exclaims, "oh please tell!"
5/18/25 3:29:15a Mr Pudding gulps a snackerel down whole.
5/18/25 3:29:16a Coriakin says, "The name is familiar, Egremora"
5/18/25 3:29:19a Warawonda ponders, "more healer stuff?"
5/18/25 3:29:19a Phroon says, "Some of us have heard of them."
5/18/25 3:29:29a Coriakin says, "But not with many details"
5/18/25 3:29:32a Egremora asks, "What have you heard?"
5/18/25 3:29:37a Biro says, "the mountain bear chieftain shares wounds with his lunar guardians; not sure how much mind that is ;]"
5/18/25 3:29:39a (Slyph glares at Wara incase she thought something bad)
5/18/25 3:29:48a (Phroon thinks about summarizing…)

5/18/25 3:30:07a Coriakin asks, "Phroon may correct me, but isn't that what the ancients called what we now call mirrors?"
5/18/25 3:30:08a Phroon says, "That they were built long ago by the Ancient Shaer"
5/18/25 3:30:18a Warawonda ponders, "healers need 100 more trianer and 50 more items."
5/18/25 3:30:23a You have given this character as much good karma as is allowed. Wait for it to decay.
5/18/25 3:30:24a Coriakin asks, "Or some other means of travel?"
5/18/25 3:30:24a You have 1376 coins.

5/18/25 3:31:41a Eli ponders, "and by lost I mean I chucked it off the mountain"
5/18/25 3:31:43a Mr Pudding raises his jar of moonshine in a hearty toast.
5/18/25 3:31:46a Garr says, "I can share the story, however it is not terribly short."
5/18/25 3:31:47a Coriakin says, "Sorry friends, can we stop bumping into Ha'ri? It's quite distracting me"
5/18/25 3:31:52a Palmeri ponders, "hell no, goats are the worst"
5/18/25 3:32:06a (Egremora ponders.)
5/18/25 3:32:13a Valadorei asks, "Gates of the Moon?"
5/18/25 3:32:14a Eli says, "well the delivery recipient sunstoned me and said they were waiting for the package cori"
5/18/25 3:32:15a Egremora asks, "Is there a shorter way of telling the truth in the story, or do you need the whole thing?"
5/18/25 3:32:27a Egremora says, "Not that I'm in a hurry. I seldom get such company."
5/18/25 3:32:28a Warawonda says, "short version"
5/18/25 3:32:33a (Seaforth kicks Slyph)
5/18/25 3:32:38a Slyph exclaims, "ow!"
5/18/25 3:32:39a Ravenstorm says, "we just need the details"
5/18/25 3:32:44a (Cecil glares at Seaforth)
5/18/25 3:32:48a Warawonda says, "no no who needs those :P"
5/18/25 3:32:49a (Coriakin chuckles)
5/18/25 3:32:54a Ravenstorm says, "^^"
5/18/25 3:32:54a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:33:03a * You learn from drinking and swapping tales by the fire.
5/18/25 3:33:14a Valadorei says, "I would prefer to hear the whole thing to be quite honest."
5/18/25 3:33:22a (Egremora smiles.)
5/18/25 3:33:26a Mr Pudding waves his jar of moonshine around wildly in the air, nearly spilling it.
5/18/25 3:33:28a Sativa says, "yar. I am not too familiar maself"
5/18/25 3:33:32a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:33:35a Sativa says, "well not enough for my curiosity"
5/18/25 3:33:39a Egremora says, "Now you must be a mystic or a storyteller yourself. Not like our little two-by-two friend with the scarf here."
5/18/25 3:33:47a Palmeri says, "I am eager to get back to stabbing things BUT i do want to know the ending"
5/18/25 3:33:51a (Seaforth squeezes water out of his wig)
5/18/25 3:33:53a (Valadorei grins.)
5/18/25 3:33:54a (Slyph laughs)
5/18/25 3:33:58a Ravenstorm says, "okay whole thing then"
5/18/25 3:34:01a Valadorei says, "Guilty."
5/18/25 3:34:08a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
5/18/25 3:34:14a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 3:34:14a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
5/18/25 3:34:14a (Coriakin): "Old Friends and New"
5/18/25 3:34:29a Warawonda ponders, "bahaha now we get the long version"
5/18/25 3:34:30a (Kani dreams of Wormtounge.)
5/18/25 3:34:40a Coriakin asks, "Sorry, I got distracted for a moment. Who's currently telling a story?"
5/18/25 3:34:41a Mr Pudding ponders, ".."
5/18/25 3:34:50a (Phroon rummages through his notes)
5/18/25 3:34:55a Seaforth asks, "WHO'S raincloud was that?"
5/18/25 3:34:55a Mr Pudding ponders, "good one"
5/18/25 3:34:59a Phroon says, "I think Garr was starting to"
5/18/25 3:35:01a Egremora says, "Nobody! We're just here talkin' about telling stories."
5/18/25 3:35:09a Garr asks, "Shall I?"
5/18/25 3:35:09a Cecil says, "you are about to get a punch cloud"
5/18/25 3:35:12a Pe Ell says, "Fewer stories about stories, more stories"
5/18/25 3:35:14a Egremora says, "I'm fit to stick my hand in a beehive just to find a new story."
5/18/25 3:35:17a Biro ponders, "starting a story is about as difficult as circle sharing"
5/18/25 3:35:18a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:35:20a Cecil exclaims, "dont kick Slyph!"
5/18/25 3:35:21a (Warawonda nods)
5/18/25 3:35:28a Kevas ponders, "Talking about doing the thing instead of doing it is a Puddleby tradition!"
5/18/25 3:35:34a Palmeri asks, "so, Egremora, none of what Cori shared so far has jogged your memory?"
5/18/25 3:35:36a (Pe Ell grins)
5/18/25 3:35:45a Egremora says, "Oh, I didn't say anything like that."
5/18/25 3:35:55a Coriakin asks, "Well, Egremora, did you know anything about creatures from other planes?"
5/18/25 3:35:56a Egremora says, "I just wanted to know what you knew about the Gates of the Moon."
5/18/25 3:36:01a Coriakin says, "Oh."
5/18/25 3:36:07a Egremora says, "Maybe you were getting impatient with your tavernkeeper asking and not telling."
5/18/25 3:36:09a Warawonda says, "no"
5/18/25 3:36:11a (Coriakin chuckles)
5/18/25 3:36:12a Warawonda says, "please tell us"
5/18/25 3:36:21a Palmeri says, "oh i definitely was, guilty as charged"
5/18/25 3:36:21a Coriakin exclaims, "No, I thought it was you leading into telling us a story about them!"
5/18/25 3:36:24a You gave signed good karma to Mr Pudding, :).
5/18/25 3:36:24a Egremora says, "Listening is a good tavernkeeper tradition, they teach it in tavernkeeping school."
5/18/25 3:36:25a (Palmeri giggles)
5/18/25 3:36:28a (Coriakin chuckles)
5/18/25 3:36:35a Seaforth ponders, "who's? whose?"
5/18/25 3:36:39a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:36:48a Egremora says, "But very well, and perhaps it's a short story than the one you didn't tell."
5/18/25 3:36:53a Coriakin says, "I'm afraid I don't know that much about the gates of the moon back in the days"
5/18/25 3:36:58a Egremora says, "Now once I told you of…"
5/18/25 3:37:03a Balangar ponders, "there are tavernkeeping schools ?"
5/18/25 3:37:04a Sativa says, ":-D"
5/18/25 3:37:05a Garr ponders, "Am I telling a story or not? I'm confused"
5/18/25 3:37:06a Egremora says, "Well, some of you, anyhow. Some of you are new faces."
5/18/25 3:37:15a Garr ponders, "Guess not"
5/18/25 3:37:17a Coriakin asks, "Didn't the famous ancient healer create them?"
5/18/25 3:37:17a Phroon says, "I was hoping you would, Garr"
5/18/25 3:37:20a Sativa says, "it's like a never ending story"
5/18/25 3:37:22a Coriakin says, "I've forgotten his name already"
5/18/25 3:37:26a Egremora says, "I told some of you the story of Mataline's mistake."
5/18/25 3:37:33a (Seaforth throws a teacup at Cecil)
5/18/25 3:37:33a (Garr nods)
5/18/25 3:37:38a Garr ponders, "I can tell it after"
5/18/25 3:37:43a Mr Pudding ponders, "zodiac?"
5/18/25 3:37:46a Cecil says, "good thing your throw like a mystic, you missed"
5/18/25 3:37:50a Warawonda ponders, "any where i can read about this?"
5/18/25 3:37:50a Egremora says, "A story about folk who think they know best, and a story about something dark and bright."
5/18/25 3:37:52a Slyph exclaims, "dont you throw teacupsd at seesaw!"
5/18/25 3:38:06a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."
5/18/25 3:38:15a (Valadorei punches Cecil in the ribs.)
5/18/25 3:38:16a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."
5/18/25 3:38:17a Ha'ri Farsight says, "Come back later when I'm more ready for help."
5/18/25 3:38:17a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."

5/18/25 3:38:30a Cecil says, "good think you punch like Seaforth, didnt feel it"
5/18/25 3:38:31a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:38:33a Biro ponders, "the road to the Abyss is paved with good intentions?"
5/18/25 3:38:34a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:38:34a Sativa says, "that sound is nicew"
5/18/25 3:38:34a Egremora says, "Well, some say Mataline was involved in this story too."
5/18/25 3:38:37a Aurian says, "that cloud attacked me first"
5/18/25 3:38:44a (Valadorei nods to Egremora)
5/18/25 3:38:45a (Phroon tilts his head.)
5/18/25 3:38:47a Aurelie asks, "Maybe a drinking song?"
5/18/25 3:38:48a Warawonda ponders, "guess not"
5/18/25 3:38:50a Aurelie says, "Heehee"
5/18/25 3:38:50a Egremora says, "For Shaer the Healer, I know that name too,"
5/18/25 3:38:51a Phroon ponders, "She gets around."
5/18/25 3:38:57a Aurian ponders, "for the record"
5/18/25 3:38:59a Egremora says, "He built a great palace, right here on our doorstep."
5/18/25 3:39:00a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."

5/18/25 3:39:02a Pe Ell says, "All songs are drinking songs if you're determined"
5/18/25 3:39:08a Warawonda asks, "oh?"
5/18/25 3:39:09a (Palmeri gumbles)
5/18/25 3:39:11a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
5/18/25 3:39:15a Sativa says, "we should always shaer the healer"
5/18/25 3:39:17a Seaforth asks, "Slyph. Have you heard the good news about the Dialectical Science of Anti-Cecilism?"
5/18/25 3:39:25a Cecil says, "Palm died, now it feels like a real hunt"
5/18/25 3:39:29a Warawonda asks, "where was this place?"
5/18/25 3:39:32a (Palmeri giggles)
5/18/25 3:39:38a (Slyph jabs C4 in the stomach)
5/18/25 3:39:39a (Egremora counts back the years.)
5/18/25 3:39:46a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:39:59a Cecil asks, "Seaforth, Slyph, do I need to turn this agoronx around?"
5/18/25 3:40:06a Biro asks, "oh, you are talking about the Shadowspring Bear cave?"
5/18/25 3:40:08a Cecil says, "stop hitting each other"
5/18/25 3:40:09a (Slyph laughs)
5/18/25 3:40:14a Egremora ponders, "Skip to the good part…"
5/18/25 3:40:15a Slyph exclaims, "he started it!"
5/18/25 3:40:18a Egremora ponders, "Impatient crowd."
5/18/25 3:40:20a (Egremora shakes her head.)

5/18/25 3:40:36a Warawonda says, "just one that doesnt seem to hear you"
5/18/25 3:40:45a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
5/18/25 3:40:45a Warawonda says, "hehe"
5/18/25 3:40:48a Seaforth says, "Teaforth"
5/18/25 3:40:51a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 3:40:51a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
5/18/25 3:40:51a (Coriakin): "The Last Truth" by Tonle
5/18/25 3:40:53a Palmeri says, "I went to the shadow spring. I wanted to dive right in, but there was also an eeriness..."
5/18/25 3:40:55a Slyph asks, "is that like our temple of the moon?"
5/18/25 3:40:59a (Garr smiles)
5/18/25 3:41:03a Egremora says, "It was a good place. First it was just one Gate of the Moon, and that story begins in Mataline's Mistake."
5/18/25 3:41:04a Warawonda says, "..."
5/18/25 3:41:13a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 3:41:16a (Valadorei nods)
5/18/25 3:41:16a (Garr nods)

5/18/25 3:41:22a Coriakin says, "I didn't know tha."
5/18/25 3:41:24a Coriakin says, "I didn't know that."
5/18/25 3:41:26a Warawonda asks, "????"
5/18/25 3:41:26a Egremora says, "That's right, or so I've been told."
5/18/25 3:41:39a Egremora says, "These are old stories, and I don't know their provenance fully. We'll call them rumors."
5/18/25 3:41:54a (Coriakin nods)
5/18/25 3:42:04a Egremora says, "Now, the water flows strangely in that place. It did then and it does now."
5/18/25 3:42:04a Palmeri asks, "Anything from those rumors that could possibly help us on our quest today?"
5/18/25 3:42:24a You have no karma to give.
5/18/25 3:42:30a (Seaforth wonders if holding this talk in a bar was a good idea)
5/18/25 3:42:37a Egremora says, "Rivers are known to change course, and that river seemed to have an appetite for novelty or new stories."
5/18/25 3:42:54a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:42:59a Sativa says, "you should really have this place checked for mold"
5/18/25 3:43:03a Egremora says, "Shaer built other gates near the first, down in the deeps."
5/18/25 3:43:08a Azzurra is no longer Clanning.
5/18/25 3:43:12a Garr asks, "The river ran through the palace?"
5/18/25 3:43:15a Phroon says, "Ahh"
5/18/25 3:43:22a (Mr Pudding remembers Tonle)
5/18/25 3:43:22a Egremora says, "With the arrival of each new gate, that river would almost overflow its banks in its eagerness to taste something new."
5/18/25 3:43:29a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:43:32a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 3:43:34a (Coriakin blinks)
5/18/25 3:43:36a (Egremora nods to Garr.)
5/18/25 3:43:38a Egremora says, "That's right."
5/18/25 3:43:46a (Egremora smiles.)
5/18/25 3:43:47a Coriakin says, "Interesting."
5/18/25 3:43:50a (Slyph blinks)
5/18/25 3:43:54a Garr says, "Ah, that would make some things make more sense"
5/18/25 3:43:56a Egremora says, "A few other storytellers among you, I see. What a lovely mushroom."
5/18/25 3:43:57a Mr Pudding ponders, "nice"
5/18/25 3:44:01a Warawonda ponders, "seem like the blood pool"
5/18/25 3:44:07a (Coriakin): "Whirling Waters" by Rakshasa
5/18/25 3:44:07a (Phroon glances at the book in Sativa's hand.)
5/18/25 3:44:09a Coriakin says, "oops."
5/18/25 3:44:11a Silky is now Clanning.
5/18/25 3:44:15a Coriakin says, "I forgot I don't have a violene anymore."
5/18/25 3:44:22a (Coriakin shakes his hea)
5/18/25 3:44:22a (Coriakin shakes his head)
5/18/25 3:44:29a Garr asks, "Did that become evil too Cori?"
5/18/25 3:44:34a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 3:44:34a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
5/18/25 3:44:34a (Coriakin): "Sleepwalking"
5/18/25 3:44:36a Pe Ell says, "Viol-ence is not always the answer, Coriakin"
5/18/25 3:44:39a Shadowfire ponders, "Violene-ce has been done to your instrument bag, Cori?"
5/18/25 3:44:42a Valadorei says, "He gave it as a gift , Garr"
5/18/25 3:44:47a Valadorei says, "He gave it as a gift, Garr"
5/18/25 3:44:48a Coriakin says, "No, Garr, I gave it to Lugubrion in the hopes he'd be inspired to write something for it"
5/18/25 3:44:49a Biro says, "probably grew legs and walked to glen, with the other Violene Arachne"
5/18/25 3:44:56a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
5/18/25 3:44:57a Egremora says, "Some stories say Shaer thought the river was the Moon's sorrow itself."
5/18/25 3:45:05a (Coriakin nods to Egremora)
5/18/25 3:45:07a (Sativa stuffs pages and a book into his pockets and acts super nonchalant)
5/18/25 3:45:13a Mr Pudding says, "Shaer, thats the healer"
5/18/25 3:45:18a Mr Pudding ponders, "o"
5/18/25 3:45:18a Coriakin asks, "Sorrow?"
5/18/25 3:45:26a Egremora asks, "This isn't even a proper story, is it?"
5/18/25 3:45:30a Mr Pudding ponders, "Shaer the healer"
5/18/25 3:45:32a Slyph asks, "Hashak, pass this to Sativa?"
5/18/25 3:45:32a Garr asks, "Was the source of the river coming from inside the palace? Or just flowing through it?"
5/18/25 3:45:37a Mr Pudding ponders, "i got you babe"
5/18/25 3:45:42a (Slyph sockss Hashak in the arm HARD)
5/18/25 3:45:48a (Silky waves)
5/18/25 3:45:49a Hashak exclaims, "hey!"
5/18/25 3:45:51a (Sativa laughs)
5/18/25 3:45:57a Slyph says, "pass it to sativa"
5/18/25 3:45:58a (Sativa claps)
5/18/25 3:45:59a Phroon says, "Rumors and history are a type of story, I suppose."
5/18/25 3:46:01a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 3:46:02a Garr ponders, "I should stop interrupting a story with questions hehe"
5/18/25 3:46:04a Egremora says, "I'm not sure as I've heard of the source, other than what I've heard Shaer thought."
5/18/25 3:46:09a (Hashak passes it to Kevas)
5/18/25 3:46:12a Valadorei says, "The Moon cried for her Children, but did as she was asked and took them from the World. She blessed them by hanging them in the night sky with her, as stars to keep her company in the dark loneliness of night."

5/18/25 4:04:09a Egremora says, "Almost never come to buy a drink. Too busy having their own tea parties."
5/18/25 4:04:14a (Slyph nods with a frown)
5/18/25 4:04:23a Egremora exclaims, "The Broodflower! Why do you keep mentioning her!"

5/18/25 4:06:57a Eli says, "its not a problem if you're winning"
5/18/25 4:06:57a Palmeri asks, "Higher the risk, higher the reward right?"
5/18/25 4:06:59a Slyph says, "that is no gamble. very wise."

5/18/25 4:07:45a Slyph says, "now I want to talk to Prue. ugh! imagine! but I do."
5/18/25 4:07:48a Sativa asks, "how many flavors of skitterlings could there be?"
5/18/25 4:07:49a Coriakin asks, "You mentioned seeing them in a book in the citadel?"
5/18/25 4:07:57a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:07:57a Cecil says, "like them all and tell us"
5/18/25 4:07:59a Egremora says, "Now, I'm sorry I hadn't actually heard any tales, just pictures in a dusty book."
5/18/25 4:08:05a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:08:07a • It’s Midnight on Sombdi, the 45th day of Summer in the 641st year of the Ascendancy, and all’s well.
5/18/25 4:08:10a (Thistle looks a little green at the thought)
5/18/25 4:08:16a Egremora says, "But I do think the Broodmoss would know."
5/18/25 4:08:19a * You are unable to see the sky from here.
5/18/25 4:08:26a Coriakin asks, "Broodmoss?"
5/18/25 4:08:29a Egremora says, "Even if she wasn't there, and I'd give you Mascarr's left bicep that she was..."
5/18/25 4:08:33a Palmeri ponders, "Broodmoss and Broodflower"
5/18/25 4:08:34a Egremora asks, "Moss?"
5/18/25 4:08:34a Coriakin says, "Sorry, I must have missed that name"
5/18/25 4:08:36a Egremora says, "Flower."
5/18/25 4:08:41a Ravenstorm says, "pls thank your healers and mystics"
5/18/25 4:08:52a Sativa says, "I don't want a bicep but thanks"
5/18/25 4:08:52a Seaforth says, "are you trying to say BLOODmoss? Her accent sounds like Liono."
5/18/25 4:08:55a Egremora says, "You'd think I was drinking my own rockslides, my tongue's just slipping and sliding."
5/18/25 4:08:59a Shadowfire ponders, "She has so many bloody names"
5/18/25 4:09:09a Egremora says, "No, not blood."
5/18/25 4:09:15a Sativa says, "brooooo"

5/18/25 4:09:23a Egremora says, "Flooooooo"
5/18/25 4:09:30a Balangar ponders, "broody names ?"

5/18/25 4:09:58a Sativa says, "that sounds like a flower thats hard to make bloom"
5/18/25 4:10:03a Egremora says, "Mostly desperation leads folk in her direction."
5/18/25 4:10:08a Warawonda says, "what was the title of this book you saw them in"
5/18/25 4:10:16a Palmeri says, "well we sure are desperate I think"
5/18/25 4:10:22a Kevas says, "Desperation has led us to many interesting places."
5/18/25 4:10:26a Coriakin says, "Wara, Egremora said she couldn't read the text. That likely includes the title"
5/18/25 4:10:30a Egremora says, "I can attempt to pronounce it, mystic."
5/18/25 4:10:34a Coriakin exclaims, "Oh, really!"

5/18/25 4:12:36a Sativa says, "are they smart or dumb"
5/18/25 4:12:37a Egremora says, "She always seems to know more than she ought to, even of things that she wasn't there for."
5/18/25 4:12:39a Warawonda asks, "is this a person or a flower?"
5/18/25 4:12:48a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
5/18/25 4:12:51a Phroon says, "She's usually hanging out near OP, could check if she's there right now."
5/18/25 4:12:53a Egremora says, "She's a crone."
5/18/25 4:13:00a Sativa says, "she is"
5/18/25 4:13:02a Mr Pudding is no longer Clanning.
5/18/25 4:13:09a • You hear Coriakin's music...

5/18/25 4:13:09a (Coriakin): "Through The Shadows"
5/18/25 4:13:15a Egremora says, "And she's bad for business. Kindly don't bring her back here."
5/18/25 4:13:21a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:13:21a (Shadowfire frowns)
5/18/25 4:13:34a Garr says, "She likes to collect connections. Perhaps this is how she learns of things"
5/18/25 4:13:55a (Phroon looks at his map and the group.)
5/18/25 4:14:00a Seaforth asks, "the who now?"
5/18/25 4:14:06a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."
5/18/25 4:14:11a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:14:12a Phroon ponders, "If we go that way half of us would get lost…"
5/18/25 4:14:14a Garr says, "I do have a question about the Shadowspring Citadel that you might know the answer to."
5/18/25 4:14:24a Garr asks, "Did it only house the Gates of the Moon? Because I read on a different island that the ancients were going to attempt to make gates of the Sun. Do you know if that ever happened?"
5/18/25 4:14:25a Phroon ponders, "That way we'd probably all fall…"
5/18/25 4:14:28a (Pe Ell is already lost)
5/18/25 4:14:31a Warawonda asks, "so just go deeper is the answer?"
5/18/25 4:14:36a Garr says, "However I'm not sure when that was written and my translation may be off."
5/18/25 4:14:42a Aurelie whispers, "Sory Cori!"
5/18/25 4:14:46a Aurelie whispers, "I'm back-ish now!"
5/18/25 4:14:46a Garr says, "Could these skitterlings perhaps be from through those gates? I'm not sure if gates of the Moon and Sun would be so close together though."
5/18/25 4:14:57a Palmeri says, "thats what I am getting Wara. Go deeper in and find brooding people"
5/18/25 4:14:59a Aurelie whispers, "Back enough to start spring showers after this one ends!"
5/18/25 4:15:13a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:15:19a Egremora says, "I never heard any mention of the Gates of the Sun."
5/18/25 4:15:27a Seaforth says, "Garr is rather articulate, for a guy who explodes all the time."
5/18/25 4:15:27a (Garr nods)
5/18/25 4:15:30a Warawonda says, "they seem to be protectors"
5/18/25 4:15:32a Egremora says, "I wonder if that's somewhere far away."
5/18/25 4:15:38a Egremora asks, "Where did you read that?"
5/18/25 4:15:48a Garr says, "It could be. The writings were on another island completely"
5/18/25 4:15:59a Kani ponders, "And shouldn't there be Gates of the Earth if there are Gates of the Sun?"
5/18/25 4:16:16a Warawonda says, "maybe there on the main island"
5/18/25 4:16:29a Egremora ponders, "Somewhere our goods ended up, I wonder?"
5/18/25 4:16:30a Warawonda ponders, "mainland*"
5/18/25 4:16:30a Valadorei ponders, "This is the earth ostensibly Kani why would we need a gate..."
5/18/25 4:16:37a Sativa says, "If someone has a name, I'm good at findin em"
5/18/25 4:16:43a Kani ponders, ""Ostensibly." ;D"
5/18/25 4:16:48a (Valadorei grins.)
5/18/25 4:16:49a Seaforth asks, "Oh! Did it not seem as if the skitterlings and the 'myrs were meant to be in conflict with each other?"
5/18/25 4:16:50a Garr ponders, "The zo must have come from somewhere"
5/18/25 4:17:03a Phroon asks, "Anyways, shall we start looking for Broodflower?"
5/18/25 4:17:04a (Palmeri giggles)
5/18/25 4:17:07a Biro asks, "the nice spooky crypt on the tropical island?"
5/18/25 4:17:09a Aurelie whispers, "Ready?"
5/18/25 4:17:10a Pe Ell ponders, "Gates of the earth are the door outside"
5/18/25 4:17:12a Palmeri exclaims, "yes! Im ready!"
5/18/25 4:17:12a Warawonda asks, "where?"
5/18/25 4:17:16a Egremora says, "Ah, the greymyr..."
5/18/25 4:17:18a • You hear Aurelie's music...
5/18/25 4:17:18a Aurelie starts playing her starbuck harp.
5/18/25 4:17:19a (Garr nods at Biro)
5/18/25 4:17:20a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:17:21a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 4:17:21a Coriakin starts playing his lucky lyra.
5/18/25 4:17:24a Sativa asks, "so this flower pops out skitters right?"
5/18/25 4:17:40a (Aurelie harps the heck out of this song.)
5/18/25 4:17:40a (Egremora laughs.)
5/18/25 4:17:46a Sativa says, ":-p"
5/18/25 4:17:47a (Coriakin): "Spring Showers" by Xepel (Arranged by Coriakin)
5/18/25 4:17:56a Egremora asks, "Did the greymyr fight the tetrapods?"
5/18/25 4:17:59a Sativa says, "they are freaky"
5/18/25 4:18:05a Coriakin says, "I don't think they did"
5/18/25 4:18:06a Garr says, "They did not"
5/18/25 4:18:13a Coriakin says, "They seemed to be unaware they were there"
5/18/25 4:18:18a (Phroon nods)
5/18/25 4:18:25a You have given this character as much good karma as is allowed. Wait for it to decay.
5/18/25 4:18:26a (Phroon plans out a route)
5/18/25 4:18:27a Sativa says, "seemed to come in packs and beeline to us"
5/18/25 4:18:32a Aurelie whispers, "I love that trill"
5/18/25 4:18:34a Seaforth says, "BUT! We speculate that the myrs are some sort of guardian gone awry."
5/18/25 4:18:39a Aurelie whispers, "So much"
5/18/25 4:18:50a Garr says, "But I feel they are already malfunctioning so that could be why"
5/18/25 4:19:01a Seaforth says, "Perhaps the myrs are meant to guard against the skitterlings, but have gone off."
5/18/25 4:19:02a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:19:16a Woolf is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:19:21a Warawonda says, "where would we find this flower"
5/18/25 4:19:22a Sativa says, "the purpose of so many golems is an interesting mystery"
5/18/25 4:19:23a Egremora says, "I believe it has been a very long time since their makers came to tell them stories of what to do."
5/18/25 4:19:30a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:19:31a (Garr nods)
5/18/25 4:19:33a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:19:36a Seaforth ponders, "stories.."
5/18/25 4:19:56a Palmeri exclaims, "I think we just go in blind! run through the whole place until we find the Broodflower!"
5/18/25 4:20:07a Warawonda says, "..."
5/18/25 4:20:09a Phroon says, "Our next stop will be the triliths near OP."
5/18/25 4:20:10a Slyph exclaims, "go in blind!"
5/18/25 4:20:10a (Seaforth glances)
5/18/25 4:20:12a Palmeri says, "Just like a fledgling hunt. Minimal plans"
5/18/25 4:20:17a Phroon says, "We'll need some feathers"
5/18/25 4:20:19a Sativa says, "lets form a commity and then take a 2 week recess and come back and vote on it"
5/18/25 4:20:22a You equip your scavenger bird feather.

5/18/25 4:20:48a Coriakin says, "What a great piece"
5/18/25 4:20:49a Egremora ponders, "I wonder how Carlos One-Hit is doing..."
5/18/25 4:20:51a Phroon says, "Garr could tell his story, or we can make our way there"
5/18/25 4:21:00a (Phroon looks around)
5/18/25 4:21:00a Coriakin says, "I had fun playing with it"
5/18/25 4:21:02a Egremora says, "I do like a good story. Mine are all fragments, today."

5/18/25 4:21:28a Biro says, "on the (mention of) the gates of the sun"
5/18/25 4:21:31a * You learn bits and pieces from the day's chatter.
5/18/25 4:21:39a (Kevas turns his attention to Garr)

5/18/25 4:22:26a Mascarr says, "Ya got here in the twilight years."
5/18/25 4:22:27a Mascarr says, "Gettin' darker every year."
5/18/25 4:22:27a Mascarr says, "Used to be, Egremora was a great healer. Maybe the best there was."
5/18/25 4:22:28a Mascarr says, "She knew more than just how to handle a moonstone."
5/18/25 4:22:28a Mascarr says, "She had a true gift. Something else."
5/18/25 4:22:28a Mascarr says, "The other healers said the moon spoke through her."
5/18/25 4:22:29a Mascarr says, "We sure were a good team."
5/18/25 4:22:29a Mascarr grunts.
5/18/25 4:22:30a Mascarr says, "We'd let Griagh tag along. She was learnin' the healer's ways."
5/18/25 4:22:30a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:22:30a Mascarr says, "And I, of course, knew how to handle an axe."

5/18/25 4:22:43a Garr says, "Watching the convergence of mountain ranges, the growth of forests, the turning of stars in the heavens."
5/18/25 4:22:43a Mascarr says, "Used to be, Egremora was a great healer. Maybe the best there was."
5/18/25 4:22:43a Mascarr says, "She knew more than just how to handle a moonstone."
5/18/25 4:22:44a Mascarr says, "She had a true gift. Something else."
5/18/25 4:22:49a Palmeri ponders, "we need to find the keyblade and the master of the keyblade, im getting deja vu"
5/18/25 4:22:49a Niblet is no longer Clanning.
5/18/25 4:22:53a Freki is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:22:53a Garr says, "The inventor drew up charts and diagrams to plot the patterns of the world."
5/18/25 4:23:00a Sativa says, "there is only Zuul"
5/18/25 4:23:02a Garr says, "The time and the place became known and named."
5/18/25 4:23:08a Garr says, "The making of the key remained."
5/18/25 4:23:15a Garr says, "To turn in that lock of worlds, the key must be made of stuff from beyond this world."
5/18/25 4:23:19a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
5/18/25 4:23:22a Garr says, "Myths told of artifacts and beings who could make a thought become reality."
5/18/25 4:23:26a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 4:23:26a Coriakin starts playing his vibra.
5/18/25 4:23:27a (Coriakin): "Elegy For A Dream"
5/18/25 4:23:30a Garr says, "The inventor set out to study the stories and find a myth that was true."
5/18/25 4:23:36a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:23:38a Garr says, "Before long, truth was discovered, closer than expected."
5/18/25 4:23:44a Garr says, "Near, indeed, to the keyhole."
5/18/25 4:23:51a Garr says, "This stuff of myth, this mystery, was machined, crafted, bound into a glowing silver key."
5/18/25 4:23:59a Garr says, "I do not know how it was bound. This secret was closely guarded and not shared with me."
5/18/25 4:24:07a Garr says, "The key and the doors were presented to the priest-king. The great work was done."
5/18/25 4:24:14a Garr says, "With much ceremony, the silver key was turned in the lock."
5/18/25 4:24:22a Garr says, "With honor, the inventor was first to travel through into the world beyond."
5/18/25 4:24:25a You gave signed good karma to Phroon, :).
5/18/25 4:24:28a Garr says, "Others followed shortly after. The doors were opened wide."
5/18/25 4:24:35a Garr says, "Thus began a rich commerce flowing into the inventor's world from this other world."
5/18/25 4:24:41a Garr says, "It seemed that any dream might become real as there was no limit on what might be imported."
5/18/25 4:24:48a Garr says, "And yet nightmares, too, are dreams."
5/18/25 4:24:54a Garr says, "The doors were overcome, thrown agape. A flood rushed through the doors into the inventor's world."
5/18/25 4:24:56a Egremora ponders, "Knives and teeth and blood and bone."
5/18/25 4:25:02a (Palmeri is amazed at Garr's story)
5/18/25 4:25:03a Garr says, "Shortly after, the doors slammed shut again. The worlds were sealed."
5/18/25 4:25:07a Egremora ponders, "Purple-black skies. Killing mists."
5/18/25 4:25:12a Garr says, "Until one day — much later — the inventor opened the door a crack and slipped through."
5/18/25 4:25:20a Garr says, "This time, the inventor stayed in the darkness on the far side of the doors — watching."
5/18/25 4:25:28a Garr says, "As the patterns of the place became known, a second key was produced."
5/18/25 4:25:29a (Shadowfire claps!)
5/18/25 4:25:35a Serius is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:25:36a Garr says, "This new key was inky black and writhed in the hand."
5/18/25 4:25:36a Freki is no longer Clanning.
5/18/25 4:25:40a Freki is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:25:40a Cecil thinks, "MR!"
5/18/25 4:25:41a Dalex is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:25:43a Garr says, "There was an imperfection, a blemish in the darkness above the other world."
5/18/25 4:25:45a Seaforth says, "groace."
5/18/25 4:25:51a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 4:25:51a Coriakin starts playing his lucky lyra.
5/18/25 4:25:51a (Coriakin): "Drifting Away"
5/18/25 4:25:52a Garr says, "Perhaps this door was jarred loose, created when the first door was opened."
5/18/25 4:25:58a (Thistle stifles a giggle)
5/18/25 4:26:00a Garr says, "Or perhaps doors in reality are everywhere, if one possesses the key."
5/18/25 4:26:06a Garr says, "The inventor turned the writhing key in the dark lock, passing through the door and away."
5/18/25 4:26:14a Garr says, "The end, she said. I have not seen her since."
5/18/25 4:26:20a Egremora asks, "Who had not seen her since?"
5/18/25 4:26:50a Garr asks, "Perhaps the statue? Perhaps the statue took that memory from someone?"
5/18/25 4:26:54a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:26:55a Garr says, "I'm not sure"
5/18/25 4:26:56a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:27:16a Garr says, "We know those who spend too long in the Shadowplane tend to forget things"
5/18/25 4:27:20a Egremora says, "That priest-king sounds like ol' Shaer, share enough."
5/18/25 4:27:26a Garr says, "Perhaps the plane absorbs the memories and that's where it came from"
5/18/25 4:27:28a Palmeri says, "ba dum tiss"
5/18/25 4:27:31a Coriakin says, "Indeed, Garr. They forget themselves"
5/18/25 4:27:31a (Phroon nods)
5/18/25 4:27:32a (Garr nods)
5/18/25 4:27:36a Sativa says, "Shaer"
5/18/25 4:27:38a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:27:40a Seaforth ponders, "I'd like to forget some things."
5/18/25 4:27:40a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:27:42a Coriakin says, "And become part of the shadowplane"
5/18/25 4:27:48a Garr says, "And I believe the inventor was Mataline"
5/18/25 4:28:05a Garr says, "This story we heard seems to connect some of the stories you previously told us"
5/18/25 4:28:11a (Phroon nods.)
5/18/25 4:28:29a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
5/18/25 4:28:31a Palmeri ponders, "thank someone"
5/18/25 4:29:03a Palmeri says, "That does fill in some holes I feel"
5/18/25 4:29:06a Egremora says, "I don't know as it connects to your Skitterlings directly, but it takes us to the place of the silver key, which is close enough."
5/18/25 4:29:13a (Garr nods)
5/18/25 4:29:19a Coriakin says, "If it's true, I wonder where she might have a passed on to"
5/18/25 4:29:30a Coriakin says, "Perhaps there are many planes, and the gates of the moon connected to several"
5/18/25 4:29:42a (Shadowfire claps!)
5/18/25 4:29:42a Coriakin says, "Perhaps there is a skittering plane, which we can avoid going to ever"
5/18/25 4:29:57a (Coriakin shudders)
5/18/25 4:29:59a Egremora says, "Dry sand and bone."
5/18/25 4:30:09a Coriakin says, "That's how it looked to me"
5/18/25 4:30:09a You have 1376 coins.
5/18/25 4:30:09a Biro exclaims, "goat plane, coriakin!"
5/18/25 4:30:18a Palmeri says, "This world has been connected. Tied to the darkness... soon to be completely eclipsed. There is so very much to learn."
5/18/25 4:30:18a (Coriakin frowns at Biro)
5/18/25 4:30:19a Egremora asks, "Or corpses, did you say? Did you happen to notice if they had any treasure?"
5/18/25 4:30:19a Pe Ell asks, "There are way too many planes. Can we collapse a few?"
5/18/25 4:30:20a Kevas says, "Or clay"
5/18/25 4:30:25a You have no karma to give.
5/18/25 4:30:26a Coriakin exclaims, "Why would you speak that into existence?!"
5/18/25 4:30:30a (Phroon tires to remember.)
5/18/25 4:30:53a Coriakin asks, "I don't believe so?"
5/18/25 4:30:54a Cecil says, "uuall the planes will crah, we dont have enough abyss traffic controllers"
5/18/25 4:31:00a Egremora ponders, "Now, Sheila gives me enough trouble, but I'm sure other folk would appreciate having a nice glass of goat milk."
5/18/25 4:31:07a Coriakin says, "Although I stayed as far from them as I could"
5/18/25 4:31:12a Palmeri says, "There are many worlds, but they share the same sky - one sky, one destiny."
5/18/25 4:31:15a Garr says, "The lightdrinkers I believe had treasure"
5/18/25 4:31:21a Seaforth says, "What if the skitterling plane is ALSO the Seaforth-with-a-flamethrower plane"
5/18/25 4:31:21a Garr says, "But my memory is poor"
5/18/25 4:31:24a Biro says, "I think some of the skitterlings were carrying coin chests"
5/18/25 4:31:34a Egremora says, "Well then, I'm sure that settles that."
5/18/25 4:31:42a Ha'ri Farsight says, "I'm still packaging ... things ... up and preparing them for those who need them."
5/18/25 4:31:46a Egremora flips a coin. It comes up tails.
5/18/25 4:32:08a Egremora says, "The gamblers among you already are already weighing or disregarding the odds."
5/18/25 4:32:14a Egremora says, "The gamblers among you are already weighing or disregarding the odds."
5/18/25 4:32:23a Slyph says, "disregarding is more like it."
5/18/25 4:32:26a Egremora says, "And would take that bet."
5/18/25 4:32:35a Egremora says, "Anyone care for another drink? Your throats are dry."
5/18/25 4:32:37a Kevas says, "They had mandibles. Some chests also."
5/18/25 4:32:44a Garr raises his glass of spider poison on high, and drains it in one gulp.
5/18/25 4:32:45a Sativa asks, "sure anyting poisonous?"
5/18/25 4:32:47a Palmeri says, "I got WAY too drunk last time"
5/18/25 4:32:49a Griagh says, "Phroon, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 4:32:49a * Your mental enhancement fades.
5/18/25 4:32:49a Griagh asks, "What’ll you have, Phroon?"
5/18/25 4:32:49a Phroon says, "tea"
5/18/25 4:32:50a Freki is no longer Clanning.
5/18/25 4:32:50a Griagh asks, "I’ll sell you a cup of high mountain tea for 5 coins. Okay with you?"
5/18/25 4:32:51a Egremora ponders, "Straight to the ground."
5/18/25 4:32:51a • You hear Coriakin's music...
5/18/25 4:32:51a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
5/18/25 4:32:51a (Coriakin): "Valadorable and Aurelovely," for Ramandu
5/18/25 4:32:51a Phroon says, "yes"
5/18/25 4:32:52a Griagh says, "Bottoms up, Phroon."
5/18/25 4:32:53a Griagh says, "Phroon, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 4:32:53a Etheriaki is now Clanning.
5/18/25 4:32:56a Seaforth says, "Also, the flamethrower could have an airhorn attached. That would be funny."
5/18/25 4:33:06a Phroon raises his cup of hot tea on high, and drains it in one gulp.
5/18/25 4:33:09a (Valadorei beams)
5/18/25 4:33:10a Egremora says, "Some of your heads are already in other planes."
5/18/25 4:33:15a Griagh says, "Sativa, I think you’d enjoy a Mirror Martyr."
5/18/25 4:33:15a (Biro orders another shot of Tavernkeep wisdom)
5/18/25 4:33:16a Griagh asks, "What’ll you have, Sativa?"
5/18/25 4:33:17a Sativa says, "fire"
5/18/25 4:33:18a Griagh asks, "Darned if I know how to make that, Sativa. How about something else?"
5/18/25 4:33:20a (Aurelie OOCly comes in from the other room when she heard this song.)
5/18/25 4:33:20a Sativa says, "hot"
5/18/25 4:33:21a Griagh asks, "Darned if I know how to make that, Sativa. How about something else?"

5/18/25 4:33:24a Mascarr takes a deep draft of a foamy, harsh-smelling drink.
5/18/25 4:33:24a Mascarr says, "Strim, Garr."
5/18/25 4:33:25a Mascarr says, "Ya got here in the twilight years."

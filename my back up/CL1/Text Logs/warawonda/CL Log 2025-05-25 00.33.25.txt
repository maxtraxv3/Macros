5/25/25 4:50:56a Strany says, "In order to stop your… Skitterlings, yes? … you'll need to find the door and close it."
5/25/25 4:51:00a Slyph says, "it's not so bad with whisket, cori"
5/25/25 4:51:02a Strany says, "Which may mean forcing your way down there."

5/25/25 4:51:57a Naferu asks, "that a thing?"
5/25/25 4:52:02a Coriakin says, "If we're forcing anything open, perhaps we can find a way of sneaking in through that exit via the library"
5/25/25 4:52:28a Sativa asks, "Is it a dangerous journey for you to walk around in these places Strany?"
5/25/25 4:52:35a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
5/25/25 4:52:36a Coriakin says, "or if we can't find a way in through here, perhaps another tunnel somewhere else leads below here"
5/25/25 4:52:53a Strany says, "Only the danger of being asked questions with little of sustenance offered in return."
5/25/25 4:52:55a Phroon says, "Ah, now that's an interesting idea, Coriakin."

5/25/25 4:54:38a Coriakin says, "that sounds like pathfinding to me."
5/25/25 4:54:39a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar whispers sweet nothings.

5/25/25 4:54:51a (Phroon nods to Coriakin.)
5/25/25 4:54:51a Izax ponders, "If they weren't meant to be opened, they should've been walls instead"
5/25/25 4:54:52a Pe Ell ponders, "Maybe we should just collapse the entry to Shadowspring and forget all these things exist"

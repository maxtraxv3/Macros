6/15/25 3:17:00a (Aurelie leafs through her music, thinking "I wonder if Bingro has heard this one...")
6/15/25 3:17:02a Cecil says, "Pelaegia, I think I left 1k ranks here last time I visited, did you happen to find them?? I am TOTALLY being honest with you."
6/15/25 3:17:02a Tart'targ mumbles to herself.
6/15/25 3:17:09a Kevas says, "They reacted as a group, seemingly to something... below."
6/15/25 3:17:20a Ravenstorm says, "definitely coordinated attacks"
6/15/25 3:17:28a (Pelaegia thinks back through the ages.)
6/15/25 3:17:32a (Bingro): Chances are, Bingro heard it but forgot about it.

6/15/25 3:18:26a Pelaegia ponders, "Underfoot, just mind things don't fall apart."
6/15/25 3:18:28a Coriakin asks, "Hmm. Didn't Egremora mention seeing something like that in a book?"
6/15/25 3:18:38a Pelaegia says, "Mostly watching and waiting."
6/15/25 3:18:40a Bingro ponders, "This song is soooo gooooood!"
6/15/25 3:18:46a Pelaegia says, "In later days, travelers and treasure-seekers."
6/15/25 3:18:49a Warawonda asks, "was there a libary?"
6/15/25 3:19:01a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Pelaegia watches and waits. Earthbender, I knew it."
6/15/25 3:19:03a Pelaegia says, "Oh, libraries, yes."

6/15/25 3:19:19a Garr asks, "We also spoke with Orchid. She mentioned that they may be coming from a gate or something down there?"
6/15/25 3:19:24a (Xepel smiles)

6/15/25 3:19:37a Ausrine asks, "Wizard treasure seekers?"
6/15/25 3:19:41a Warawonda asks, "the books?"
6/15/25 3:19:53a Garr ponders, "If anyone better remembers what Strangler Fig told us... I don't"
6/15/25 3:19:53a Pelaegia says, "All sorts. Many of them adventurers like yourselves."
6/15/25 3:20:00a Naferu says, "reader never steal and thieves never read"
6/15/25 3:20:01a Aurelie starts playing her starbuck harp.
6/15/25 3:20:02a (Aurelie): Learning the Steps - For Giben
6/15/25 3:20:05a (Seaforth looks for Kat and Jeepers)
6/15/25 3:20:14a (Pelaegia frowns again.)
6/15/25 3:20:15a Giben says, ":)"
6/15/25 3:20:19a Bingro ponders, "Sounds... familiar."
6/15/25 3:20:22a Pelaegia ponders, "Underfoot, I told you to watch!"
6/15/25 3:20:49a Pelaegia says, "They'd share stories with me from whence they came."
6/15/25 3:21:02a Pelaegia says, "Or of transformations they'd had down in the water."
6/15/25 3:21:15a Pelaegia says, "At the time, I thought it a fair trade. I was just to keep the place from falling apart."
6/15/25 3:21:32a Pelaegia asks, "Was there a book you thought you needed?"
6/15/25 3:21:35a (Pelaegia looks worried.)
6/15/25 3:22:00a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:22:04a Elenis Reyav ponders, "All books are needed books."
6/15/25 3:22:05a Garr says, "Egremora mentioned a book, but I don't think we got a title"
6/15/25 3:22:05a (Coriakin claps quietly)
6/15/25 3:22:09a Pelaegia says, "I don't recall seeing anything like you're describing. Only the shadowy things that came just before I came here to safety."
6/15/25 3:22:10a Warawonda says, "the book had strange symbols on it"
6/15/25 3:22:29a • You hear Bingro's music...
6/15/25 3:22:29a Bingro starts playing his gitor.
6/15/25 3:22:30a (Bingro): Recovery
6/15/25 3:22:30a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Particularly the ones I haven't read on pathfinding and absorbing healing energy."
6/15/25 3:22:34a Coriakin says, "Hmm. From what strangler fig said they were there a long time ago"
6/15/25 3:22:35a Warawonda says, "triangle is shape"
6/15/25 3:22:36a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:22:39a Warawonda says, "in*"
6/15/25 3:22:46a Coriakin says, "A very long time ago"
6/15/25 3:23:08a Tart'targ says, "It would have been before your time, Underfoot."
6/15/25 3:23:17a Pun'isher thinks, "KPUN reports! Lore Tour is happening. We have our reporter implants on the seen."
6/15/25 3:23:24a Coriakin says, "But the worry is that they might be hiding somewhere deeper under the citadel than we've ever gone"
6/15/25 3:23:35a Tart'targ says, "We dealt with those creatures long ago."
6/15/25 3:23:38a (Tart'targ spits on the ground.)
6/15/25 3:23:43a (Coriakin nods)
6/15/25 3:23:45a Ausrine asks, "dealt with, how?"
6/15/25 3:24:00a Garr asks, "Oh? so you know of the creatures we're talking of?"
6/15/25 3:24:11a Warawonda asks, "where there any books on the ether? or mirrors?"
6/15/25 3:24:14a (Tart'targ cocks her head sideways.)
6/15/25 3:24:20a Catan is no longer Clanning.
6/15/25 3:24:24a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
6/15/25 3:24:38a Tart'targ says, "A witch wouldn't forget a thing like that."
6/15/25 3:24:48a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
6/15/25 3:24:53a Ravenstorm says, "they look like Alien larva from the movie Alien and Aliens"
6/15/25 3:25:06a Tart'targ says, "More like to a spider's web than to the creatures we know here."
6/15/25 3:25:06a Coriakin says, "Well, unfortunately they seem to have returned, somehow."
6/15/25 3:25:17a (Valadorei gawks at Ravenstorm's nonsense.)
6/15/25 3:25:18a Warawonda asks, "what kind of books did these libarys keep?"
6/15/25 3:25:22a Ravenstorm says, "haha"
6/15/25 3:25:28a (Tart'targ smiles at Warawonda.)
6/15/25 3:25:28a Ravenstorm says, "well close enough"
6/15/25 3:25:32a You gave signed good karma to Suu'ub III, :).
6/15/25 3:25:48a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:25:51a Tart'targ says, "We burned the nest and sealed the gate, sure enough."
6/15/25 3:26:02a (Xepel is very pro-burning)
6/15/25 3:26:04a • You hear Coriakin's music...
6/15/25 3:26:04a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
6/15/25 3:26:04a (Coriakin): "Ostinato"
6/15/25 3:26:14a Bingro ponders, "Great choice!"
6/15/25 3:26:20a Kevas says, "Strangler Fig said there was more than one hive."
6/15/25 3:26:23a Xepel asks, "Where was the nest? Is it still accessible?"
6/15/25 3:26:24a Tart'targ asks, "Did Orchid have any words about why they were back?"
6/15/25 3:26:55a (Garr tries to remember)
6/15/25 3:27:05a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:27:06a Coriakin asks, "I don't think so, but given the timing maybe it has something to do with the agronox seal?"
6/15/25 3:27:11a Kevas says, "Nothing I reall about why."
6/15/25 3:27:20a Ravenstorm says, "pls thank your healers and mystics"
6/15/25 3:27:23a Tart'targ says, "At that time they'd set up shop in the lesser-traveled corners o' the place."
6/15/25 3:27:29a Coriakin asks, "Perhaps they were deterred by the shadows? Or something else formed a path up into the citadel we know?"
6/15/25 3:27:33a Kevas says, "But, to stop them, we would have to find some kind of door and close it."
6/15/25 3:27:33a Garr says, "This wasn't the first time we encountered these creatures either"
6/15/25 3:27:41a Tart'targ says, "Where they could multiply in the dark fer a while fore folk found 'em out."
6/15/25 3:27:56a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:27:56a Garr says, "But this time they were out with much greater force and numbers"
6/15/25 3:28:02a (Tart'targ grumbles.)
6/15/25 3:28:03a (Aurelie smiles!)
6/15/25 3:28:08a (Wayfarer claps)
6/15/25 3:28:09a Tart'targ says, "Soundin' familiar."
6/15/25 3:28:12a Valadorei asks, "Um... how fast do they seem to multiply?"
6/15/25 3:28:15a (Coriakin nods)
6/15/25 3:28:24a Xepel starts playing his casserole.
6/15/25 3:28:24a (Xepel): Wonderment
6/15/25 3:28:25a Warawonda asks, "perhaps we could speak with the hive queen ?"
6/15/25 3:28:31a Vylarian thinks, "is it too late for me to join lore hunt?"
6/15/25 3:28:36a Tart'targ says, "I'm no kinda expert on exobiology."
6/15/25 3:28:52a Tart'targ says, "First there was a few, then there was a lot."
6/15/25 3:28:59a (Valadorei nods.)
6/15/25 3:28:59a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:29:00a Coriakin thinks, "We're visiting Tart'targ, just east of the mountain entry. Can you pathfind into the south puddleby island landing?"
6/15/25 3:29:03a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:29:06a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:29:18a Tart'targ says, "If you want some kinda natural philosopher's notes on their birth rates, maybe that woulda been in the library."
6/15/25 3:29:34a Tart'targ says, "Which Underfoot shoulda kept an eye on."
6/15/25 3:29:36a Valadorei says, "That seems more than enough insight for our purposes."
6/15/25 3:29:41a Pelaegia cringes.
6/15/25 3:29:43a Xepel thinks, "You'll need pathfinding to get in south island, a little durability to get here, and a mystic to let you in the rest of the way (but I'm sure one here can step out for you)"
6/15/25 3:29:46a Coriakin asks, "Sorry for the aside, but can anyone help Vylarian pathfind on the ocean to get here?"
6/15/25 3:29:59a Tasus attempts to project into another plane.
6/15/25 3:30:03a Elenis Reyav says, "I'm willing, Cor.. ah"
6/15/25 3:30:04a Warawonda asks, "perhaps we could clear out this libary?"
6/15/25 3:30:07a Elenis Reyav says, "Looks like Tasus is going."
6/15/25 3:30:15a Mablum is no longer Clanning.
6/15/25 3:30:18a Vylarian thinks, "ok, out of my league getting there solo. When is the lore hunt normally?"
6/15/25 3:30:19a Coriakin says, "Sounds like the library's already been cleared out, Warawonda"
6/15/25 3:30:25a (Tart'targ chuckles darkly.)
6/15/25 3:30:34a Garr asks, "Are there more libraries deeper in the Citadel? I'd thought we'd found our wany into a library there?"
6/15/25 3:30:44a Xepel thinks, "Normally starts a half hour ago. Tasus is coming for you, though"
6/15/25 3:30:45a (Valadorei smiles softly.)
6/15/25 3:30:58a (Tart'targ bobs her head.)
6/15/25 3:31:17a Idun is now Clanning.
6/15/25 3:31:24a Tart'targ says, "Least a few more. Not that I'd have high hopes of anything deeper."
6/15/25 3:31:33a You gave signed good karma to Dandelion, :).
6/15/25 3:31:34a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:31:36a Idun is no longer Clanning.
6/15/25 3:31:37a (Aurelie claps quietly.)
6/15/25 3:31:39a Tart'targ says, "They were abandoned longer ago."
6/15/25 3:31:43a (Garr nods)
6/15/25 3:31:45a Warawonda asks, "why?"
6/15/25 3:31:47a Coriakin asks, "The deepest we've gone is the Agronox Seal room. What is deeper than that?"
6/15/25 3:32:07a Aurelie starts playing her gitor.
6/15/25 3:32:07a (Aurelie): Turning Pages
6/15/25 3:32:12a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:32:18a Garr says, "I would assume The Gates of the Moon Cori"
6/15/25 3:32:21a Ausrine says, "In an orderly way? I'd hate to go through the trouble of getting there and finding dust."
6/15/25 3:32:25a Tart'targ says, "Downways? Gates o' the Moon, such as they may still be. Ceremonial chambers, store rooms, libraries, livin' quarters..."
6/15/25 3:32:26a (Valadorei nods at Garr.)
6/15/25 3:32:30a Elenis Reyav exclaims, "ttS ilk Yeah, there are a lot. It would be nice if someone kept track of them all somewhere!"
6/15/25 3:32:31a (Elenis Reyav grins.)
6/15/25 3:32:34a (Coriakin nods)
6/15/25 3:32:40a (Tart'targ squints at Elenis Reyav.)
6/15/25 3:32:49a (Elenis Reyav whistles innocently.)
6/15/25 3:32:50a Tart'targ says, "Feel the same way about you, ranger man."
6/15/25 3:33:05a Elenis Reyav says, "That's very fair."
6/15/25 3:33:11a Elenis Reyav says, "Wicky lady"
6/15/25 3:33:26a Coriakin asks, "But you said they were abandoned. Were those levels sealed off as well?"
6/15/25 3:33:26a Inu Teisei thinks, "I see Elenis has taken the LA™ course in Premier Sinstoning"
6/15/25 3:33:28a Wayfarer says, "hm."
6/15/25 3:33:35a Tart'targ says, "Yeah."
6/15/25 3:33:39a Ravenstorm says, "is there a way to detect where they are coming from? and then we hopefully enter from there"
6/15/25 3:33:45a Cecil thinks, "his sinstone went inert"
6/15/25 3:33:46a Elenis Reyav thinks, "I'm not only a student, I'm also a teacher!"
6/15/25 3:33:51a Tasus thinks, "Outside Mystic sparkles"
6/15/25 3:34:04a Ausrine thinks, "coming."
6/15/25 3:34:04a Garr asks, "Were shadows coming from deeper in the Citadel as well?"
6/15/25 3:34:04a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
6/15/25 3:34:04a Coriakin says, "It seems like we may want to try to get down there to investigate"
6/15/25 3:34:06a Inu Teisei thinks, "is this ye application to join LA™, Elenis?"
6/15/25 3:34:07a Tart'targ says, "Bit surprisin' that the Nibblers would be able to get through all that but..."
6/15/25 3:34:12a Katreesa is now Clanning.
6/15/25 3:34:13a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:34:15a Tart'targ says, "S'been a fair age since that time."
6/15/25 3:34:24a (Wayfarer claps)
6/15/25 3:34:26a Bingro ponders, "Hmmm. What to play next?"
6/15/25 3:34:32a Elenis Reyav thinks, "My application is waiting on our ability to join multiple clans!"
6/15/25 3:34:34a Bingro ponders, "I'm in a Gitor mood today."
6/15/25 3:34:39a • You hear Bingro's music...
6/15/25 3:34:39a Bingro starts playing his gitor.
6/15/25 3:34:40a (Bingro): Light is Shadow's Death
6/15/25 3:34:49a (Seaforth waves)
6/15/25 3:34:49a Vylarian says, "thank you all"
6/15/25 3:34:51a Xepel asks, "Do we have to go through the seal? Or are there other ways down we haven't found yet?"
6/15/25 3:34:57a Pelaegia exclaims, "Welcome welcome!"
6/15/25 3:35:01a Ravenstorm says, "ty"
6/15/25 3:35:15a Inu Teisei thinks, "/pray GMs please bring us more ways to affiliate like say one of your ever so helpful reps"
6/15/25 3:35:17a Tart'targ says, "Ordinarily I'd be recommendin' against openin' up sealed things, but it sounds like they're openin' on their own."
6/15/25 3:35:17a Garr says, "There's a staircase covered in rubble Xepel, Maybe we just need to hire some diggers"
6/15/25 3:35:21a Naferu says, "We must unite the clans under one lord"
6/15/25 3:35:23a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:35:33a Naferu says, "I propose a crusade"
6/15/25 3:35:33a Coriakin says, "If there's a way up, I imagine there's a way down. Maybe not a way we could traverse without four legs and no heads, but..."
6/15/25 3:35:41a Tart'targ says, "Buried in rubble and magically sealed. Figured if one didn't do it, the other would."
6/15/25 3:35:42a Coriakin says, "Maybe not a way we could traverse without four legs and no heads, but..."
6/15/25 3:35:49a (Seaforth perks up at the mention of a crusade)
6/15/25 3:35:51a Inu Teisei ponders, "ruh roh, crusades are never a good thing"
6/15/25 3:35:53a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Sounds like a sneak opening is in order."
6/15/25 3:36:01a Kevas ponders, "Let's hold off on elective surgery as an exploration technique, for now."
6/15/25 3:36:05a Xepel says, "Some exiles act like they have no heads, I'm sure we can find a way"
6/15/25 3:36:10a (Tart'targ smirks.)
6/15/25 3:36:10a Naferu ponders, "don't be a party poper"
6/15/25 3:36:17a Elenis Reyav exclaims, "That's no act, Xepel!"
6/15/25 3:36:19a Tart'targ asks, "So what are you thinkin'?"
6/15/25 3:36:21a Aurelie exclaims, "Tart'targ turned me into a newt once! It was painless and adorable!"
6/15/25 3:36:22a Ausrine asks, "how can we bypass your magical sealant?"
6/15/25 3:36:22a (Xepel grins)
6/15/25 3:36:23a (Inu Teisei pops a party cracker)
6/15/25 3:36:37a Katreesa thinks, "hope things are going well, and hi"
6/15/25 3:36:40a Bingro asks, "Who would you say acts like they have no heads and why Stinkfist?"
6/15/25 3:36:43a (Xepel claps!)
6/15/25 3:36:49a (Xepel grins)
6/15/25 3:36:50a Tart'targ ponders, "Next time I'll make it a little more painful so she remembers it less fondly."
6/15/25 3:36:57a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Yet another reason I wear a cloak all the time.. helps hide my lack of mental acuity."
6/15/25 3:37:02a Aurelie thinks, "H'lo, Kat! Just havin' a little chat with Tart'targ and Pelaegia."
6/15/25 3:37:08a Coriakin says, "Well, Tart'targ, I think we're wondering whether you can let us know of any possible paths down to lower levels..."
6/15/25 3:37:09a Garr says, "Puddleby has some diggers that have experience digging into the unknown, maybe we can talk to them"
6/15/25 3:37:18a Tart'targ says, "Might just need to open it again."
6/15/25 3:37:25a Coriakin says, "... or if there might be some other way of getting down there. A tunnel from the outside of some kind"
6/15/25 3:37:26a Garr ponders, "As long as they haven't been killed by the Darshak spirits"
6/15/25 3:37:26a Seaforth thinks, "right about now"
6/15/25 3:37:28a Kevas asks, "Is that... wise?"
6/15/25 3:37:29a Xepel asks, "I suggest explosives. Do we have enough orga firewater?"
6/15/25 3:37:31a (Bingro pokes Cori)
6/15/25 3:37:33a (Tart'targ mutters.)
6/15/25 3:37:34a You gave signed good karma to Hashak, :).
6/15/25 3:37:37a Coriakin says, "Oh."
6/15/25 3:37:44a Naferu ponders, "Cecil seems to have a thin for C4"
6/15/25 3:37:49a Naferu ponders, "Cecil seems to have a thing for C4"
6/15/25 3:37:52a • You hear Coriakin's music...
6/15/25 3:37:52a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
6/15/25 3:37:52a Garr says, "There is a stash of unused explosives on Ash Island as well if we don't mind robbing the rebels"
6/15/25 3:37:52a (Coriakin): "Sunlight Through The Shadows"
6/15/25 3:37:54a Ausrine ponders, "been meaing to reassign Melabrion's dwarves."
6/15/25 3:37:55a Inu Teisei ponders, "that was AP"
6/15/25 3:38:05a Warawonda says, "hmm"
6/15/25 3:38:08a Elenis Reyav asks, "Aren't we trying to get more orga firewater to learn how to make stout chains?"
6/15/25 3:38:15a Seaforth asks, "Stirring up trouble today, Narfoo?"
6/15/25 3:38:22a Inu Teisei shows her stout chain to everyone.
6/15/25 3:38:24a Tart'targ says, "I'm thinking explosives might not be the thing for a crumbling old place, but you know, I'm just a witch."
6/15/25 3:38:27a Xepel ponders, "Stout chains are made of explosives?"
6/15/25 3:38:35a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:38:36a Naferu says, "just kneading the dough"
6/15/25 3:38:37a Garr says, "Someone like Trillbane or Injaros might be able to find a way through as well."
6/15/25 3:38:43a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:38:44a Coriakin says, "Well, some of us are pretty experienced at digging with shovels and the like"
6/15/25 3:38:46a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:38:51a Coriakin exclaims, "Oh, good point Garr!"
6/15/25 3:38:54a Naferu says, "it will rise in time"
6/15/25 3:38:55a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Fountfell smith indicated they were used in refining the metal to make stout chains."
6/15/25 3:38:56a (Inu Teisei gets hungry for fresh baked tortillas)
6/15/25 3:38:58a Aurelie asks, "What...with these dainty hands?"
6/15/25 3:38:59a (Seaforth thumsb up)
6/15/25 3:39:00a Tart'targ says, "Maybe you're experts with demolitions."
6/15/25 3:39:06a Xepel ponders, "Ahhh."
6/15/25 3:39:08a (Aurelie winks at Cori.)
6/15/25 3:39:15a Inu Teisei ponders, "with butter"
6/15/25 3:39:17a Bingro ponders, "Love that part!"
6/15/25 3:39:18a Tart'targ says, "Trillbane, now that's an idea."
6/15/25 3:39:22a Coriakin exclaims, "Some, Aurelie. Not all!"
6/15/25 3:39:24a Inu Teisei ponders, "and meelk"
6/15/25 3:39:35a (Tart'targ counts on her fingers.)
6/15/25 3:39:45a Elenis Reyav asks, "Ah, has Trillbane finished his latest novel yet?"
6/15/25 3:39:50a Tart'targ exclaims, "Ha!"
6/15/25 3:39:51a Warawonda asks, "no way to make our own moon gate way and connect to down there?"
6/15/25 3:39:56a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:39:57a Tart'targ asks, "Has Trillbane ever written a word for himself?"
6/15/25 3:39:59a Aurelie exclaims, "Wait...they're NOVELS?!"
6/15/25 3:40:07a Elenis Reyav says, "Really mean of him to leave us all on a cliffhanger with book 3."
6/15/25 3:40:09a Naferu says, "Maybe there is a manual for that"
6/15/25 3:40:11a (Coriakin looks at Warawonda, horrified)
6/15/25 3:40:11a Xepel asks, "Why do you think they take days or weeks to read?"
6/15/25 3:40:19a Tart'targ says, "If you liked those, you're welcome."
6/15/25 3:40:22a Coriakin asks, "You want to connect our town to whatever's down there?"
6/15/25 3:40:25a Tart'targ ponders, "His latest novel indeed."
6/15/25 3:40:33a Warawonda asks, "who said town?"
6/15/25 3:40:33a Cecil asks, "does Trillbane make an audio book?"
6/15/25 3:40:34a Elenis Reyav says, "Well, dictation, or whatnot. I don't know that he *writes* them himself."
6/15/25 3:40:37a Coriakin says, "Most doors open in two directions..."
6/15/25 3:40:38a Inu Teisei ponders, "two sheets is a novel?"
6/15/25 3:40:41a Xepel starts playing his conch.
6/15/25 3:40:41a (Xepel): Death March
6/15/25 3:40:45a Tart'targ says, "Shovels for diggin' out rubbles."
6/15/25 3:40:57a Seaforth says, "I will quote the great Lard Almighty: "There is no problem that cannot be solved by the application of sufficient explosives.""
6/15/25 3:41:13a Tart'targ says, "A witch for openin' a seal. A few reagants to make the way clear."
6/15/25 3:41:24a Tart'targ says, "And yeah, maybe Trillbane could help squeeze his way through all them tons of rock."
6/15/25 3:41:32a Tart'targ says, "He always did know how to move his hips."
6/15/25 3:41:37a Inu Teisei ponders, "ewww"
6/15/25 3:41:40a Kevas asks, "Reagents? What would you need?"

6/15/25 3:42:52a Tart'targ ponders, "Doin' an'… undoin'"
6/15/25 3:43:18a Tart'targ says, "Few agronox feathers might help. Bottle o' wind..."
6/15/25 3:43:28a (Coriakin smiles at Katreesa)
6/15/25 3:43:33a Seaforth asks, "What about a Dwarven Arguemancer?"
6/15/25 3:43:33a (Bingro claps!)
6/15/25 3:43:34a Naferu shows his snickersnack potion to everyone.

6/15/25 3:44:01a Garr asks, "A bottle of wind?"
6/15/25 3:44:01a Seaforth asks, "DO we have a Dwarven Arguemancer?"
6/15/25 3:44:04a You equip your Staff of Ballou.
6/15/25 3:44:05a You slip your Staff of Ballou into your backpack.
6/15/25 3:44:06a Naferu shows his roaring potion to everyone.

6/15/25 3:44:17a (Aurelie): The Spaces They've Left
6/15/25 3:44:23a (Naferu): the wind roars
6/15/25 3:44:23a Pun'isher thinks, "KPUN reporter on the field. Slyph sends her hellos to all. She is sad to miss and have to only observe"
6/15/25 3:44:41a Garr says, "We might be able to capture a wind elemental, but I'm not sure how we'd put it in a bottle"
6/15/25 3:44:47a Seaforth says, "hi Slyph"
6/15/25 3:44:53a Naferu says, "It should blend"
6/15/25 3:44:58a You have 2539 coins.
6/15/25 3:45:10a Izax is now Clanning.
6/15/25 3:45:11a (Naferu stirs)
6/15/25 3:45:36a Tart'targ says, "We'd want to collect a few mushrooms, too."
6/15/25 3:45:37a Inu Teisei thinks, "please remember to give generously to Slyph's wardrobe and other goodies fund. Contact any LA™ member for details. No really it's like totally legit."
6/15/25 3:45:46a Tart'targ says, "Panther Caps wouldn't do at all, we'd just lose track o' the work."
6/15/25 3:45:47a Izax is no longer Clanning.
6/15/25 3:45:53a Garr ponders, "Can't work without a snack"
6/15/25 3:45:55a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/15/25 3:45:58a Seaforth says, "Honestly, I can't think of any particularly argumentative Dwarves in Puddleby."
6/15/25 3:46:07a Seaforth says, "which is weird."
6/15/25 3:46:15a Xepel ponders, "I think Seaforth has never met Gorvin"
6/15/25 3:46:15a * Your mental enhancement fades.

6/15/25 3:52:40a Elenis Reyav says, "Not the little wooden fellows who walk around in bubbles."
6/15/25 3:52:41a Garr exclaims, "And if words don't work we can diplomatically ask with our swords!"

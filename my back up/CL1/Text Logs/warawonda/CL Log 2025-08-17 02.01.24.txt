8/17/25 4:50:28a Phroon says, "Joining things, like some of the creatures here are joined together."
8/17/25 4:50:33a Cecil asks, "are the prisms what gives the aura to the frostlights?"
8/17/25 4:50:33a Garr asks, "Or can we not see from our vantage above it?"
8/17/25 4:50:36a Astilbe says, "It might account for the durability of these caverns unto themself."
8/17/25 4:50:45a Nyarlathotep asks, "can the heart of ice turn my lava cloak into an ice cloak?"
8/17/25 4:50:57a Kalian says, "You should eat yours Cecil"
8/17/25 4:50:59a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Hrm. Like silk and metal might be melded, yes, that aligns with a particular smiths intent."
8/17/25 4:50:59a * Your mental enhancement fades.
8/17/25 4:51:00a Astilbe says, "The sun through the prism, perhaps."
8/17/25 4:51:12a Astilbe asks, "Have you found many of these prisms?"

8/17/25 4:51:19a Kalian juggles his ice prism from one hand to the other.
8/17/25 4:51:20a Shadowfire asks, "Just two I think?"
8/17/25 4:51:21a Astilbe asks, "Is there one that I and the others of my order might study?"
8/17/25 4:51:21a Cecil says, "I'm in my ranking aura"
8/17/25 4:51:22a Elenis Reyav says, "No. Very few."
8/17/25 4:51:25a (Astilbe nods.)
8/17/25 4:51:28a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
8/17/25 4:51:32a Astilbe says, "Perhaps when you have more, then, and they are less dear to you."
8/17/25 4:51:36a • You hear Coriakin's music...
8/17/25 4:51:36a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
8/17/25 4:51:37a (Coriakin): "Ostinato"
8/17/25 4:51:53a Nug asks, "not much use to us now are they?"
8/17/25 4:51:59a Garr asks, "Perhaps a trade. Maybe you can show us the way to Stormlyric in exchange?"
8/17/25 4:52:01a Inu Teisei says, "how many sides/planes are on the heart"
8/17/25 4:52:05a Seaforth asks, "Give the man a prism, eh?"

8/17/25 4:52:11a Astilbe says, "Straight to the point, I see."
8/17/25 4:52:19a Elenis Reyav says, "Garr is direct like that, yes."
8/17/25 4:52:21a Elenis Reyav says, "We appreciate him."
8/17/25 4:52:22a Astilbe says, "I'd have to discuss that with Andrachnea. It is not mine to offer."
8/17/25 4:52:23a Garr says, "The Abbess has been uncooperative"
8/17/25 4:52:31a (Phroon nods.)
8/17/25 4:52:39a Elenis Reyav says, "It can sometimes cut to the Heart of the matter."
8/17/25 4:52:40a Cecil asks, "is there a place in the lands where the sun shines the strongest?"
8/17/25 4:52:42a You have 8478 coins.
8/17/25 4:52:47a You gave signed good karma to Distortions, :).
8/17/25 4:52:48a Garr ponders, "Sunspire perhaps"
8/17/25 4:52:49a Astilbe asks, "But she would indeed be interested. Is that the only trade you would offer?"
8/17/25 4:52:49a Inu Teisei ponders, "a crystal per heart sides?"
8/17/25 4:52:50a (Phroon nods to Cecil.)
8/17/25 4:52:54a You just received anonymous good karma.
8/17/25 4:52:54a Phroon says, "Sunspire, Cecil."
8/17/25 4:52:56a Shadowfire ponders, "That would be my thought as well"
8/17/25 4:53:00a Seaforth ponders, "time for a snack"
8/17/25 4:53:03a Garr ponders, "Or even the Temple of the sun in Peaceton might be worthwhile"
8/17/25 4:53:08a Elenis Reyav says, "I suspect an infinity stone would be a reasonable trade as well."
8/17/25 4:53:13a (Elenis Reyav whistles innocently.)
8/17/25 4:53:15a Aurian ponders, "peaceton? im listening"
8/17/25 4:53:20a (Nyarlathotep kick some ice)
8/17/25 4:53:23a (Nyarlathotep sighs)
8/17/25 4:53:24a Astilbe says, "Ah, we know well the ways of infinity."
8/17/25 4:53:28a Garr asks, "We are good at solving problems as well, perhaps there is something she needs?"
8/17/25 4:53:35a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar growls soothingly.
8/17/25 4:53:40a Wayfarer shows his infinity stone to everyone.
8/17/25 4:53:42a Astilbe asks, "Do you have any experts among you on mirrors? Gates?"
8/17/25 4:53:46a Elenis Reyav says, "Put your conundrum to us and we might treat it as a quest."
8/17/25 4:53:53a (Coriakin blinks)
8/17/25 4:53:54a (Garr looks toward Aki)
8/17/25 4:53:57a (Noivad smiles)
8/17/25 4:53:58a Coriakin asks, "Why do you ask?"
8/17/25 4:53:58a Aurian asks in Sylvan, "Mirror shards, etc?"
8/17/25 4:53:59a Astilbe asks, "Their repair?"
8/17/25 4:54:04a Aurian asks, "Mirror shards, etc?"
8/17/25 4:54:06a Phroon says, "Aha…"
8/17/25 4:54:07a Garr asks, "Their repair?"
8/17/25 4:54:16a Astilbe says, "As you may know, the sisters of Windweft are struggling with their mirror."
8/17/25 4:54:27a Garr says, "Perhaps an agreement can be made with those in Windweft. They have been working on repairing a mirror"
8/17/25 4:54:28a (Warawonda nods)
8/17/25 4:54:29a Cecil asks, "can we use the cloud in combination of the prism for some super storm/cloud?"
8/17/25 4:54:34a (Coriakin slings his gitor strap over his shoulder and quickly checks the tuning.)
8/17/25 4:54:41a Noivad says, "great idea"
8/17/25 4:54:43a • You hear Coriakin's music...
8/17/25 4:54:43a Coriakin starts playing his gitor.

8/17/25 4:58:40a Phroon says, "We're always up for a bit of knowledge."
8/17/25 4:58:42a You have 8902 coins.
8/17/25 4:58:45a Astilbe says, "You haven't helped much at Windweft, so far. A few jewels, perhaps."

8/17/25 4:59:55a Astilbe says, "And if she finds your price too high, I'm sure a little patience will lower it."
8/17/25 4:59:56a Garr says, "The mirror at windweft seems more on an experiment to them, they do not know what will happen when it is repaired"
8/17/25 5:00:00a You discern that the local ether activity is a little less than you would expect.
8/17/25 5:00:11a Sephroth is now Clanning.
8/17/25 5:00:23a Garr asks, "I feel like they've alluded to danger on the other side?"

8/17/25 5:01:10a Coriakin says, "Opening a door to an unknown location from your home seems... fraught"
8/17/25 5:01:19a Aurian says, "then we love it"
8/17/25 5:01:20a (Garr nods at Coriakin)
8/17/25 5:01:23a Astilbe says, "Yes. Cataclysms come to mind."
8/17/25 5:01:28a (Phroon nods.)
8/17/25 5:01:31a (Aurian likes cats)
8/17/25 5:01:33a Phroon says, "Not wise"
8/17/25 5:01:34a (Kevas glances at Astilbe)
8/17/25 5:01:37a Astilbe says, "You will understand why Andrachnea is not eager to open a door to her own home, so to speak."

8/17/25 5:01:55a Cecil asks, "what if we bring lots of beer?"
8/17/25 5:02:01a Coriakin asks, "And yet we've been good friends to the other monasteries. I think?"
8/17/25 5:02:09a Astilbe says, "They seem to think so."
8/17/25 5:02:11a Garr asks, "Perhaps a delegation first then? To ease her mind?"
8/17/25 5:02:19a Nug ponders, "bloodpopcycle"
8/17/25 5:02:23a Astilbe says, "So, despite the obvious folly, I will bring her your offers."
8/17/25 5:02:29a * Your mental enhancement fades.
8/17/25 5:02:29a Distortions says, "i have memories of the ripture"
8/17/25 5:02:34a (Coriakin grins)

8/17/25 5:02:38a Noivad asks, "a bloppsicle?"
8/17/25 5:02:42a Kevas ponders, "Are we petitioners, here? It seems to me that we are the ones who have something to trade?"
8/17/25 5:02:44a Aurian ponders, "was kinda fun ;)"
8/17/25 5:02:45a Cecil asks, "are they distorted?"
8/17/25 5:02:46a Warawonda asks, "do you know where we could learn more about repairing mirrors?"
8/17/25 5:02:48a Coriakin says, "As someone who teaches, I assume you that folly is the first step towards wisdom"
8/17/25 5:02:50a Garr asks, "Bird would be faster I think?"
8/17/25 5:02:55a (Astilbe nods.)
8/17/25 5:02:55a Coriakin says, "As someone who teaches, I assure you that folly is the first step towards wisdom"
8/17/25 5:03:01a Astilbe says, "Very well."
8/17/25 5:03:07a Garr says, "So long as you can summon one here and send it off"
8/17/25 5:03:12a (Wayfarer chuckles)
8/17/25 5:03:12a Inu Teisei ponders, "so LA™ style then?"
8/17/25 5:03:20a Valadorei incants in a mystical language.
8/17/25 5:03:41a (Astilbe nods to Valadorei.)

8/17/25 5:05:04a Nug yells, "thoom"
8/17/25 5:05:15a Seaforth asks, "We have two prisms. Have we tried making glasses?"
8/17/25 5:05:32a Elenis Reyav ponders, "What sights one might see!"
8/17/25 5:05:36a Aurian ponders, "glasses as a PF object would be cool"
8/17/25 5:05:37a Phroon says, "Sometimes the options seem endless."
8/17/25 5:05:40a Cecil says, "I'm too cute to go to prism"
8/17/25 5:05:46a Seaforth says, "What sort of prism"
8/17/25 5:06:03a Seaforth says, "does it divide light, or polarize it or"
8/17/25 5:06:15a Coriakin says, "Well, we should consider heading back to Puddleby soon"
8/17/25 5:06:18a Astilbe says, "I hope that we may both gain by exchange. I merely need to consult the Abbess before any final decisions are made."
8/17/25 5:06:21a Garr asks, "Something else to offer. We've employed a master pathfinder to help us deeper into the Shadowspring Citadel. Perhaps even to the Gates of the Moon. Maybe we can offer knowledge of what is found inside?"
8/17/25 5:06:27a You just received good karma from Kalian, loretour hasnet found one so they have no say over the people who found them on our own hunts
8/17/25 5:06:37a Coriakin says, "It sounds like we have an offer extended, which is plenty for a first meeting"
8/17/25 5:06:41a Astilbe asks, "Ah, yes. Trillbane, Injaros, or another?"
8/17/25 5:06:51a Inu Teisei ponders, "Injaros?"
8/17/25 5:06:53a * Your mental enhancement fades.
8/17/25 5:06:54a Elenis Reyav asks, "Is there any small bartering we might do with you, Astilbe?"
8/17/25 5:06:55a * Your mental enhancement fades.
8/17/25 5:07:01a Noivad asks, "who is Injaros?"
8/17/25 5:07:02a Coriakin asks, "Giayl, perhaps?"

8/31/25 3:12:40a Elenis Reyav ponders, "I wonder if there's a pebble in the greymyr tunnel."
8/31/25 3:12:43a (Elenis Reyav grins.)
8/31/25 3:12:44a Talin ponders, "if that made sense"
8/31/25 3:12:54a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Haha, it did."
8/31/25 3:13:01a Elenis Reyav ponders, "I always have plenty of other stuff to do."
8/31/25 3:13:09a Ponyo is no longer Clanning.
8/31/25 3:13:11a Talin asks, "where you can farm zu?"
8/31/25 3:13:11a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Like right now.. also cooking some chicken and tofu curry!"
8/31/25 3:13:21a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:13:23a Talin says, "I am either concentrated or ... errr concentrated"
8/31/25 3:13:30a Elenis Reyav says, "That's usually my reading time too ^_^"
8/31/25 3:13:32a Talin exclaims, "aahaa!"

8/31/25 3:14:12a Talin says, "when I read I forget the zu, and wake up when it dies haha"
8/31/25 3:14:17a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Erg. Right, I still need to murder the key 'maker' and try to reclaim my pass key."
8/31/25 3:14:30a Elenis Reyav says, "Hehee, that's why I read next to my computer."
8/31/25 3:14:34a You show your portal pass key to everyone.
8/31/25 3:14:35a Talin ponders, "oh, murdering key makers sounds like fun!"
8/31/25 3:14:39a Elenis Reyav says, "So I can glance at it once in a while."
8/31/25 3:14:47a (Aurelie beams!)
8/31/25 3:14:55a Elenis Reyav says, "The other kind of pass key, sadly Warawonda."
8/31/25 3:14:57a Talin says, "I could too, except I forget the world exists, in general"
8/31/25 3:15:04a Elenis Reyav says, "Tenebrion gave it to me.. a long time go."
8/31/25 3:15:14a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
8/31/25 3:15:17a (Elenis Reyav grins.)
8/31/25 3:15:35a Elenis Reyav ponders, "That's why I have to read near computer if getting kudzu farmed."
8/31/25 3:15:42a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Because the world does disappear otherwise."
8/31/25 3:15:43a Talin ponders, "can we go kill him now? wara looks like we might have help"
8/31/25 3:15:46a Warawonda says, "maybe orngise a lore tuor to kick them out of pub"
8/31/25 3:15:58a Elenis Reyav says, "Is that an option? We should do that."
8/31/25 3:16:09a Warawonda says, "try asking phoon"
8/31/25 3:16:10a Elenis Reyav says, "I even have an amazing proposal."
8/31/25 3:16:15a Warawonda says, "or garr"
8/31/25 3:16:16a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:16:21a Elenis Reyav says, "Kick him out of the house in West Puddleby."
8/31/25 3:16:28a Elenis Reyav says, "And let the shieldstone repair fellow move in."
8/31/25 3:16:36a Warawonda says, "that wont happen"
8/31/25 3:16:49a Elenis Reyav asks, "Why so?"
8/31/25 3:16:58a Warawonda says, "where they are is balanced"
8/31/25 3:16:59a Talin says, "careful what you are wishing for they will put him to inner Ash or something"
8/31/25 3:17:16a Elenis Reyav ponders, "I suspect Colmert just likes having their name said constantly."
8/31/25 3:17:16a (Talin nods at Wara)
8/31/25 3:17:50a Elenis Reyav says, "I'm not sure who it is balanced around."
8/31/25 3:18:26a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Hopefully I'm not getting myself and others into deep water."
8/31/25 3:18:33a Talin says, "eh, shieldstone is op. it could be in more annoying places"
8/31/25 3:18:37a Warawonda says, "if you ask them about it im sure someone will make it much harder to reapir"
8/31/25 3:18:43a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
8/31/25 3:18:44a Koppi yells, "Kanzeon reports: This Friday (8/29) at 7PM Pacific three will be a Book 2 trip by Connie Crete's mosey"
8/31/25 3:19:08a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Charge a lot more and make it repairable in town.. we could use more coin sinks."
8/31/25 3:19:10a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:19:18a Warawonda says, "not coins"
8/31/25 3:19:19a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Keep the other option available!"
8/31/25 3:19:35a Elenis Reyav asks, "What then?"
8/31/25 3:19:40a Kalian says, "doubt that would happen because it's not lik eit's hard to repair them now"
8/31/25 3:19:50a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
8/31/25 3:19:50a Warawonda says, "maybe require you remake the ring"
8/31/25 3:20:09a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Say folks who are certainly among the more powerful shieldstone users."
8/31/25 3:20:14a Elenis Reyav ponders, "So definitely some bias there."
8/31/25 3:20:22a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Freely admit that."
8/31/25 3:20:40a Warawonda says, "i hosntly think the item should of been a healer item"
8/31/25 3:21:04a Zylle is no longer Clanning.
8/31/25 3:21:09a Elenis Reyav says, "I think that'd be a pretty keen option. Likely needs a bit different tuning for healer spirit, but I agree."
8/31/25 3:21:15a Talin says, "there should be a healer version"
8/31/25 3:21:25a Talin says, "ya"
8/31/25 3:21:33a Eirian Caldwell asks, "of what?"
8/31/25 3:21:33a Warawonda says, "well if you make the ring a fake exile"
8/31/25 3:21:36a Elenis Reyav says, "Shieldstone."
8/31/25 3:21:44a Warawonda says, "they use it like it was healing it"
8/31/25 3:22:00a Coriakin is now Clanning.
8/31/25 3:22:04a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:22:19a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Given the grove guardian, klarik, etc.. making a healer ring/amulet that does that bubble would make sense."
8/31/25 3:22:20a Eirian Caldwell says, "I think pretty much everyone agrees, except, it seems, the GMs"
8/31/25 3:22:22a (Coriakin waves)
8/31/25 3:22:24a Warawonda says, "witch would disable there healing and lower the spirit uses"
8/31/25 3:22:31a Warawonda says, "balancing"
8/31/25 3:22:32a Eirian Caldwell exclaims, "good point!"
8/31/25 3:22:47a Crius yells, "It’s 10 o’clock, and all’s well."
8/31/25 3:22:48a Talin ponders, "it might be 1 GM tbh"

8/31/25 3:23:26a Rawks is no longer Clanning.
8/31/25 3:23:29a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Ruby amulet -> Defensive Talisman. Creates a bubble like a grove guardian. Significantly increased spirit drain."
8/31/25 3:23:44a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Don't think it needs to disable healing. Just has to ramp the drain over time."
8/31/25 3:23:55a Koppi yells, "Kanzeon reports: This Friday (8/29) at 7PM Pacific three will be a Book 2 trip by Connie Crete's mosey"
8/31/25 3:23:57a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Likely exponentially after a few seconds, but still."
8/31/25 3:24:02a Talin says, "disable healing would be fine"
8/31/25 3:24:07a Warawonda says, "then how do you fix the spirit use"
8/31/25 3:24:09a Talin ponders, "for me"
8/31/25 3:24:22a Elenis Reyav says, "I'm not sure I follow what you mean by spirit use there, Wara."
8/31/25 3:24:27a Warawonda says, "healer have much lower spirit trainers"
8/31/25 3:24:58a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:25:02a Elenis Reyav says, "I'm still not sure what you mean."
8/31/25 3:25:09a Warawonda asks, "?"
8/31/25 3:25:15a Talin says, "but existing healers have trained a shitton, you do not want them to shield a day long"
8/31/25 3:25:21a Zylle is no longer Clanning.
8/31/25 3:25:23a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Exactly what Talin said."
8/31/25 3:25:30a Warawonda says, "k check gorvins website"
8/31/25 3:25:33a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Like, most healers don't train for tons of sespus."
8/31/25 3:25:36a Talin says, "discussions were always about healers already have too much spirit"
8/31/25 3:25:36a Kalian says, "If anything it's going to be a different thing entirely from a shieldstone"
8/31/25 3:25:36a Warawonda says, "trainers"
8/31/25 3:26:04a Talin ponders, "spirit gain, of course"
8/31/25 3:26:10a Warawonda says, "20k spetus =/= 2000 fighter spirit"
8/31/25 3:26:10a Elenis Reyav says, "You balance it around the goal of how long a healer out to be able to keep the shield going."
8/31/25 3:26:13a Talin ponders, "not sespus"
8/31/25 3:26:22a Elenis Reyav says, "You balance it around the goal of how long a healer ought to be able to keep the shield going."
8/31/25 3:26:51a Elenis Reyav says, "I'd treat it like after 1.5s the drain ramps up exponentially quickly."
8/31/25 3:27:19a Warawonda asks, "if want a shield like that why would a healer need it, as it wouldnt work like a sheild stone?"
8/31/25 3:27:21a Elenis Reyav says, "So that by 4-5 seconds it becomes unsustainable for 90% of healers."
8/31/25 3:27:33a Elenis Reyav says, "Because the purpose is different."
8/31/25 3:27:46a Kalian says, "My point is that if they make some sort of escape for healers its not going to be a shieldstone"
8/31/25 3:27:48a Warawonda says, "that would make it more a mystical tool"
8/31/25 3:27:53a You have 9596 coins.
8/31/25 3:27:56a Elenis Reyav says, "Correct me if I'm wrong, but healers particularly want it to be able to get out of a trapped situation."
8/31/25 3:28:10a Talin says, "could be, kal. some are in, just too rare to make"
8/31/25 3:28:34a Warawonda says, "they call them fighters"
8/31/25 3:28:36a Talin says, "maybe they were intended as such"
8/31/25 3:28:37a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "think I'm going to go get a good seat"
8/31/25 3:28:38a Warawonda says, "heh"
8/31/25 3:28:42a Talin says, "hehe wara"

8/31/25 3:29:06a Koppi yells, "Prowl reports: A Laughing Academy inquiry. Herpetid Hides - An overlooked asset? Ripe for breakthrough applications or forever a drain on storage fees? You decide."
8/31/25 3:29:51a Warawonda says, "you cant have an item that isnt balanced, or it wont be fun"
8/31/25 3:29:56a (Elenis Reyav chuckles.)
8/31/25 3:30:03a Warawonda says, "it will become abusive"
8/31/25 3:30:11a Elenis Reyav ponders, "I literally balance combat for video games as my job. In MMOs."
8/31/25 3:30:20a (Warawonda frons)
8/31/25 3:30:23a Warawonda says, "i hope not"

8/31/25 3:32:14a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
8/31/25 3:32:20a Talin ponders, "I think there is some misunderstanding here..."
8/31/25 3:32:28a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Possibly."
8/31/25 3:32:54a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Wara saying "i hope not" after I mention that I balance combat in games for a living felt insulting."
8/31/25 3:32:57a Reed is now Clanning.
8/31/25 3:33:23a Talin thinks to you, "he works for other MMOs, and balancing combat is his job there. so yeah, he likely understands something about balancing items :)"

8/31/25 3:34:19a Talin ponders, "understandably so. but I doubt it was meant so."
8/31/25 3:34:32a (Elenis Reyav sighs.)
8/31/25 3:34:41a Warawonda asks, "?"
8/31/25 3:34:43a Coriakin thinks, "Bard concert in 25 minutes!"
8/31/25 3:34:57a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
8/31/25 3:35:10a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
8/31/25 3:35:14a Elenis Reyav ponders, "I get it all the time when someone believes they know 'balance'. That's fine."

8/31/25 3:35:26a Shadowmutt growls, "Woof!"
8/31/25 3:35:34a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
8/31/25 3:35:52a Elenis Reyav asks, "What did you mean when you said "i hope not"?"
8/31/25 3:35:54a Talin ponders, "hehe, those jobs, eh. everyone a gamer, so everyone knows more. I have one of those too. everyone a psychologist :D"

10/12/25 4:52:35a Ausrine says, "90% sure that Bindra has two eyes."
10/12/25 4:52:37a Kasarra asks, "Anyone am having another bottle of fire water?"
10/12/25 4:52:42a (Garr nods)
10/12/25 4:52:43a Nug picks up a bottle of fire water.
10/12/25 4:52:49a Garr picks up a bottle of fire water.
10/12/25 4:53:00a Stinkfist says, "ya but Ausrine, the orga know magic, i bet they could magic two eyes if they really had to"
10/12/25 4:53:08a Phroon says, "Volatile stuff."
10/12/25 4:53:12a Ponyo says, "bindra is 2 small orga in an overcoat. it's true."
10/12/25 4:53:15a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
10/12/25 4:53:18a Garr asks, "Was that yours Seaforth?"
10/12/25 4:53:18a Stinkfist says, "probably through teleportation magic "accidents" tho"
10/12/25 4:53:22a Seaforth says, "it was"
10/12/25 4:53:28a Garr says, "I have another as well if it would help Kasarra"
10/12/25 4:53:32a Nug says, "it was mine for about 2 seconds XD"
10/12/25 4:53:37a (Kasarra growls.)
10/12/25 4:53:38a Seaforth says, "I am a river to my people."
10/12/25 4:53:39a Crunch says, "I think I saw Bindra using bottles of orga pee in her chain-making, that might not work very well"
10/12/25 4:53:45a Kasarra asks, "Anyone am having ANOTHER bottle of fire water?"
10/12/25 4:53:47a (Stinkfist cackles)
10/12/25 4:53:49a Ausrine says, "I haven't met an Orga edgy enough to engage in that kind of self-mutilation."
10/12/25 4:53:54a Elenis Reyav ponders, "Kasarra is clearly quite the smith. Very fire resistant."
10/12/25 4:54:04a Garr says, "Third time's the charm"
10/12/25 4:54:06a Kasarra says, "Kasarra maybe am needing to take it more slowly with this fire water stuff."
10/12/25 4:54:07a Ponyo asks, "how many orga HAVE you been meeting with ausrine?"
10/12/25 4:54:08a Stinkfist asks, "ya but angry enough?"
10/12/25 4:54:16a Kasarra asks, "How you say the Orga am making this?"
10/12/25 4:54:20a Ponyo asks, "are you a part of bindra's evil plot?"
10/12/25 4:54:27a Warawonda says, "magic"
10/12/25 4:54:29a Stinkfist says, "ummm with lots of hatred and anger we presume"
10/12/25 4:54:37a Warawonda says, "moon magic"
10/12/25 4:54:38a Garr says, "Their alchemists like to throw it at us more than explain their methods"
10/12/25 4:54:38a Stinkfist says, "mebbe some magic"
10/12/25 4:54:39a Elenis Reyav says, "Klaussi thinks they use the fire water to strengthen the iron."
10/12/25 4:54:42a Phroon says, "Not sure, but they load it into their catapults and throw them to attack us."
10/12/25 4:54:42a Ausrine says, "well I have lots of hatred and anger."
10/12/25 4:54:44a You have 20117 coins.
10/12/25 4:54:44a Thoomilicious says, "fermentation"
10/12/25 4:54:56a Seaforth says, "Perhaps it oozes out of ground and then the Orga purify it using fractional distillation."
10/12/25 4:55:02a Seaforth asks, "?"
10/12/25 4:55:03a Elenis Reyav says, "Since it has such a high temperature, it purifies the iron."
10/12/25 4:55:03a Ponyo asks, "have you tried saying the magic words "Kill", and "Die"?"
10/12/25 4:55:04a Stinkfist says, "ok the fire water thing actually sounds like science"
10/12/25 4:55:07a (Aurelie fixes her braid.)
10/12/25 4:55:08a Kasarra says, "OK, Kasarra am hearing lots of crazy stories."
10/12/25 4:55:13a Elenis Reyav says, "They also use more iron in their chains."
10/12/25 4:55:13a Stinkfist says, "so lets go with that one"
10/12/25 4:55:17a Kasarra says, "It am OK to say you do not know."
10/12/25 4:55:19a Warawonda asks, "steel?"
10/12/25 4:55:24a (Phroon grins.)
10/12/25 4:55:26a Eli says, "its all an elaborate plan to keep big iron and loomva in charge"
10/12/25 4:55:27a (Ausrine coughs)
10/12/25 4:55:30a Coriakin says, "Crazy stories are something exiles are good at producing"
10/12/25 4:55:32a Elenis Reyav says, "We don't know, that's why we'd like help. ^_^"
10/12/25 4:55:33a Garr says, "I would trust Elenis over the rest of us in most things"
10/12/25 4:55:39a Nyarlathotep ponders, "carbonated acid geyser water?"
10/12/25 4:55:46a Ausrine exclaims, "Kilt!"
10/12/25 4:55:46a Kasarra says, "Kasarra will study this chain and this fire water. Carefully."
10/12/25 4:55:47a Ausrine exclaims, "Dye!"
10/12/25 4:55:50a Warawonda ponders, "maybe charged iron?"
10/12/25 4:55:54a (Phroon nods.)
10/12/25 4:55:55a (Ponyo nods)
10/12/25 4:55:56a Kevas ponders, "We like to call them creative theories, not crazy stories."
10/12/25 4:55:56a Kasarra asks, "What was next question?"
10/12/25 4:56:00a Ponyo says, "careful Ausrine"
10/12/25 4:56:01a Stinkfist says, "Arr may your science be great Kasarra"
10/12/25 4:56:01a Cecil asks, "maybe we should try to temper the hot iron in cold mystic blodd?"
10/12/25 4:56:04a You gave signed good karma to Phroon, :).
10/12/25 4:56:05a Stinkfist says, "dont blow up"
10/12/25 4:56:05a Coriakin says, "Garr, your turn."
10/12/25 4:56:07a (Phroon looks to Garr.)
10/12/25 4:56:07a Ponyo says, "silky might hunt you down at this rate"
10/12/25 4:56:08a Ausrine says, "well I ;'have lots of hatred and anger."
10/12/25 4:56:08a Elenis Reyav says, "Thank you Kasarra, truly it is appreciated."
10/12/25 4:56:09a Ausrine says, "]"
10/12/25 4:56:16a Seaforth says, "Lets listin te Cecil."
10/12/25 4:56:17a Garr exclaims, "You had tasked us with searching for the heart of ice!"
10/12/25 4:56:20a Darrdra asks, "Thoomilicious, do you want me to polish your weapon deep river blue for 5000 coins?"
10/12/25 4:56:22a Kalian says, "something something ice prisms"
10/12/25 4:56:24a Darrdra waits for a response.
10/12/25 4:56:30a Kasarra says, "Speaking of crazy stories. Yes."
10/12/25 4:56:31a * Your mental enhancement fades.
10/12/25 4:56:36a (Eirian Caldwell grins.)
10/12/25 4:56:38a Garr says, "We found it, but it's a lot bigger than what we thought so we can't bring it to you"
10/12/25 4:56:40a (Elenis Reyav grins.)
10/12/25 4:56:47a Kasarra asks, "Maybe you am needing to train more to pick it up?"
10/12/25 4:56:52a (Kasarra looks pointedly at Seaforth.)
10/12/25 4:56:58a Seaforth ponders, "!"
10/12/25 4:56:59a (Phroon laughs.)
10/12/25 4:57:00a Garr says, "But a few of us have found these neat little ice prisms"
10/12/25 4:57:09a Coriakin says, "It was more.... uh.... floating in space, in a spot we couldn't get to"
10/12/25 4:57:12a (Garr points at the ice prisms)
10/12/25 4:57:19a (Phroon nods to Coriakin.)
10/12/25 4:57:23a Coriakin says, "So lifting it wasn't really the problem"
10/12/25 4:57:25a Kasarra asks, "Ice prisms?"
10/12/25 4:57:27a Stinkfist says, "Arr i could probably steal it with astral projection but like"
10/12/25 4:57:31a Garr says, "Cecil was waving his around earlier if you saw it"
10/12/25 4:57:32a Seaforth says, "I train to inspire, and Leg Day does not inspire."
10/12/25 4:57:37a You have 20117 coins.
10/12/25 4:57:38a Kasarra says, "Kasarra did not get a good look."
10/12/25 4:57:39a Stinkfist says, "honestly that seems like a magically bad idea to steal it"
10/12/25 4:57:41a Warawonda ponders, "isnt not a living thing?"
10/12/25 4:57:59a Elenis Reyav says, "Are they chips from the heart of ice? We aren't sure."
10/12/25 4:58:01a (Garr looks around at the prism holders)
10/12/25 4:58:01a Kasarra asks, "It can be placed carefully on the floor? Or too fragile?"
10/12/25 4:58:05a (Phroon looks around for someone with a prism.)
10/12/25 4:58:22a Cecil shows his ice prism to everyone.
10/12/25 4:58:34a Elenis Reyav says, "Give Cecil some space"
10/12/25 4:58:44a Kasarra says, "Oh."
10/12/25 4:58:50a Aurelie says, "Pretty..."
10/12/25 4:58:59a (Kasarra's eyes glint in the reflected firelight.)
10/12/25 4:58:59a Elenis Reyav says, "See how it doesn't melt even when near the forge? Something special."
10/12/25 4:59:00a Stinkfist says, "Arr that looks pretty magic to me"
10/12/25 4:59:04a Klaussi exclaims, "Strim!"

10/12/25 4:59:17a Fortuna says, "that was shiny"
10/12/25 4:59:18a Coriakin says, "From what I gather from the rumour and stories..."
10/12/25 4:59:22a Kasarra ponders, "I want that."
10/12/25 4:59:27a Cecil asks, "do you need?"
10/12/25 4:59:28a Stinkfist says, "Cecil, I order you to give that to Kasarra for science"
10/12/25 4:59:30a Kasarra says, "Yes."
10/12/25 4:59:34a Coriakin asks, "The heart of ice has some power that involves combining things with different natures?"
10/12/25 4:59:35a Kasarra says, "Yes, Kasarra needs that."
10/12/25 4:59:39a Kasarra picks up an ice prism.
10/12/25 4:59:50a (Stinkfist puts a +1 point next to Cecil's name)
10/12/25 4:59:53a (Phroon nods to Coriakin.)
10/12/25 4:59:56a (Kasarra runs a calloused finger along the edge of the prism.)
10/12/25 4:59:58a Warawonda ponders, "of fire and ice -.?"
10/12/25 5:00:07a Thoomilicious says, "afk a sec"
10/12/25 5:00:08a Stinkfist ponders, "He keeps this up he gonna get that promotion to Brotenant"
10/12/25 5:00:30a You have 20117 coins.
10/12/25 5:00:34a (Kasarra holds the prism up to the forge, looking for beads of sweat or any sign of melting.)
10/12/25 5:00:44a Crunch ponders, "Hope she doesn't freeze her forge"
10/12/25 5:01:01a Eli says, "I dont wanna think about my ice sweating"
10/12/25 5:01:02a Warawonda ponders, "cold fusion forge"

10/12/25 5:01:12a Cecil says, "just dont starting singing "let it go""
10/12/25 5:01:27a Kasarra ponders, "It am amazing they put up with him."
10/12/25 5:01:31a Seaforth says, "Oh, right. The heart of ice was for Silksteel, not chains."
10/12/25 5:01:41a Cecil says, "I dont think they have a choice at this point"
10/12/25 5:01:41a (Seaforth remembers that)
10/12/25 5:01:43a (Warawonda nods)
10/12/25 5:01:45a Kasarra asks, "Am Orga having these ice prisms?"
10/12/25 5:01:48a Aurelie says, "Sounds fancy."
10/12/25 5:01:51a Warawonda says, "no"

10/12/25 5:01:52a (Phroon shakes his head.)
10/12/25 5:01:53a Coriakin says, "Yes, but some exiles are very fond of chains."
10/12/25 5:01:59a Coriakin says, "Too fond."
10/12/25 5:02:00a Kevas says, "Not that we know of."
10/12/25 5:02:00a Elenis Reyav says, "Not that we have seen."
10/12/25 5:02:05a You gave signed good karma to Coriakin, :).
10/12/25 5:02:08a Elenis Reyav says, "They're very far from the mountain."
10/12/25 5:02:12a Seaforth says, "Silksteel sounds as if it could be used for armored underpants"
10/12/25 5:02:16a Eli says, "so far just these glowy things that look like ice"
10/12/25 5:02:18a Warawonda says, "orga have yet to reach that part of the mountion"
10/12/25 5:02:19a Stinkfist says, "Arr I'm pretty sure the Orga would try and destroy where we found these"
10/12/25 5:02:26a Vylarian ponders, "i think someone just admitted to having a chain centered torture chamber"
10/12/25 5:02:37a (Kasarra growls in quiet satisfaction.)
10/12/25 5:02:40a Kasarra asks, "There am more of these?"
10/12/25 5:02:47a Phroon says, "Not many more."
10/12/25 5:02:47a Seaforth says, "Ponyo, you look like a stereo speaker."
10/12/25 5:03:00a Phroon asks, "But at least one?"
10/12/25 5:03:07a Kalian says, "Maybe"
10/12/25 5:03:10a Thoomilicious says, "play music and she changes colors"
10/12/25 5:03:10a Kasarra asks, "More can be obtained?"
10/12/25 5:03:17a (Phroon nods.)
10/12/25 5:03:20a Phroon says, "Slowly, but yes"
10/12/25 5:03:24a You have 20117 coins.
10/12/25 5:03:26a Eli says, "theres 1 or 2 others among exiles not present"
10/12/25 5:03:29a Elenis Reyav says, "They seem to be very rare, but yes."
10/12/25 5:03:46a (Kasarra is lost in thought for a moment.)
10/12/25 5:03:47a Elenis Reyav says, "Dropped from a powerful ice creature near the heart of ice."
10/12/25 5:03:56a Ponyo says, "funny glowy ice rock dude"
10/12/25 5:03:58a Phroon asks, "Ice, or maybe sun?"
10/12/25 5:03:58a Elenis Reyav says, "And only rarely."
10/12/25 5:04:12a (Elenis Reyav nods.)
10/12/25 5:04:23a Kasarra says, "Kasarra am noticing..."
10/12/25 5:04:24a Eli says, "a boss thats not a boss ive been told"
10/12/25 5:04:32a * Your mental enhancement fades.
10/12/25 5:04:37a Kasarra says, "You am bringing prisms, but no map drawn to the heart of ice."
10/12/25 5:04:42a Ponyo ponders, "the nug vs glau troilus race intensifies."
10/12/25 5:04:43a Warawonda ponders, "ice powered by the sound"
10/12/25 5:04:50a Kasarra asks, "Guarded secret?"
10/12/25 5:05:00a Elenis Reyav says, "No secret."
10/12/25 5:05:04a Coriakin says, "It's quite a dangerous area"

10/12/25 5:05:05a Stinkfist says, "someone draw this zo a map"
10/12/25 5:05:06a Elenis Reyav says, "We'd lead you there, probably."
10/12/25 5:05:07a Eli says, "we have a map the person who drew it isnt present though"
10/12/25 5:05:09a Crunch asks, "Do you want to go with us, sometime?"
10/12/25 5:05:12a Kalian says, "Unless you can smash through a blocked passage we're not able to get close enough"
10/12/25 5:05:21a Elenis Reyav says, "But it is quite a trek."
10/12/25 5:05:26a (Phroon nods.)
10/12/25 5:05:32a Coriakin asks, "Did you want to set up a forge downthere, Kasarra?"
10/12/25 5:05:34a Warawonda says, "there are clues on how to activate it"
10/12/25 5:05:38a Nyarlathotep ponders, "fire water bomb to blow up passage!"
10/12/25 5:05:42a Coriakin says, "I don't know if there's a safe area down there to do so..."
10/12/25 5:05:45a Klaussi exclaims, "Strim!"
10/12/25 5:05:58a Warawonda says, "music maybe a key"
10/12/25 5:06:02a Thoomilicious asks, "perhaps we can carve one in the ice?"
10/12/25 5:06:02a Aurelie asks, "Music?"
10/12/25 5:06:08a Kasarra says, "Kasarra am wondering about setting up a smithy at this heart of ice."
10/12/25 5:06:10a Eli says, "deep in the slidey cave there's a big ice prism suspended in the air"
10/12/25 5:06:15a Garr says, "Those from Stormlyric seem safe enough Cori. And Kasarra is much stronger than them I'm sure"
10/12/25 5:06:15a Cecil picks up a main gauche.

10/12/25 5:06:47a (Crunch glances in appreciation at Kasarra's hammer)
10/12/25 5:06:54a Garr ponders, "how gauche"
10/12/25 5:07:00a Kasarra says, "Easy, but Kasarra am busy with new masterwork."
10/12/25 5:07:09a Stinkfist asks, "Yarr?"
10/12/25 5:07:11a Thoomilicious asks, "what's that?"
10/12/25 5:07:13a * Your mental enhancement fades.
10/12/25 5:07:17a Ausrine ponders, "you and Melabrion."
10/12/25 5:07:19a (Kasarra caresses the prism.)
10/12/25 5:07:25a Seaforth says, "That hammer is a clumsy lump. NOT a weapon anyone would lift for battle."
10/12/25 5:07:38a Stinkfist says, "Crunch isnt anyone"
10/12/25 5:07:39a You concentrate on sending your message to Aurelie.
10/12/25 5:07:39a You think to Aurelie, ""A group of singing musicians are pictured with their instruments in front of a large crystal." one of the pic in the ice there"
10/12/25 5:07:41a Stinkfist says, "He's Crunch"
10/12/25 5:07:43a Kevas ponders, "Not unlike... oh, nevermind."
10/12/25 5:07:43a Crunch ponders, "KILL"
10/12/25 5:07:44a Stinkfist says, "Badass of Legend"
10/12/25 5:07:58a Kasarra asks, "A great hammer for war or smithing?"
10/12/25 5:08:05a You gave signed good karma to Ceara, :).
10/12/25 5:08:10a Garr ponders, "Why not both!"
10/12/25 5:08:26a Kasarra ponders, "Gilded in litharge, no doubt. These exiles have a taste for the extravagant."
10/12/25 5:08:34a (Phroon grins.)
10/12/25 5:08:34a Elenis Reyav says, "We generally seek knowledge of blacksmithing arts."
10/12/25 5:08:43a Nyarlathotep says, "Just a tool, Smithing in peace, Smushing in war."
10/12/25 5:08:46a Elenis Reyav says, "If you can share any recipes, we'd be most appreciative."
10/12/25 5:08:52a Thoomilicious says, "we need leg protection"
10/12/25 5:09:10a Elenis Reyav says, "Stout chains, main gauches, there are many others. Someone said silksteel once upon a time."
10/12/25 5:09:11a You have 20117 coins.
10/12/25 5:09:17a Ponyo says, "I think Kasarra just really wants a cozy smith next to the big floaty ice rock"
10/12/25 5:09:22a Stinkfist says, "silksteel sounds comfy"

3/16/25 5:03:48a Coriakin says, "So we could find a way of safely closing it"
3/16/25 5:03:49a Garr says, "Inside it looks like the darshak are corrupting kyuems somehow? Or doing something strange with the ether"
3/16/25 5:03:49a Kalian says, "Some sort of mirror as well"

3/16/25 5:03:53a Lugubrion says, "So there will be a need to find where it is concentrated"
3/16/25 5:03:55a Sativa says in Thoom, "u23"
3/16/25 5:03:56a Lugubrion says, "Since some have entered and returned, I assume it is not as deadly as could be feared"

3/16/25 5:03:59a Garr says, "Well it wasn't the nicest place I've ever been. and the tunnels are a bit cramped"
3/16/25 5:04:00a Seaforth thinks, "Might need a PF to get Lovsya from West TI"
3/16/25 5:04:00a (Sativa washes off)
3/16/25 5:04:01a (Aurelie remembers she doesn't have PF)
3/16/25 5:04:01a Inu Teisei thinks, "should we be doing an intervention instead for poor depressed Luggy?"

3/16/25 5:04:03a Aurelie thinks, "Lord Lugubrion is just fine, a bit of melancholy is good for the soul!"
3/16/25 5:04:03a Coriakin says, "We found some defenders, but nothing worse than we've faced before. I think."
3/16/25 5:04:04a Garr asks, "Shall we go check out the problem?"
3/16/25 5:04:04a Aye'Cha thinks, "If catan falls, I'm in TC and can go after him."
3/16/25 5:04:05a Coriakin says, "Sounds good to me, Garr."
3/16/25 5:04:05a Sativa says in Thoom, "I'm not leading our rabble, but I personally think it would be funto go on walkabout with you Lord Lugubrion"
3/16/25 5:04:06a Lugubrion says, "If you are planning to enter as a group..."

3/16/25 5:07:58a Kordal ponders, "wait, if it keeps cycling, how does it accumulate?"
3/16/25 5:07:58a Lugubrion says, "Then let us proceed below so we have the whole picture"
3/16/25 5:07:59a Biro says, "dar'shak necromancers would never do unethical experiments in evil temples"

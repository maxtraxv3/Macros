3/31/25 1:20:58a Tigger ponders, "Wish I could get this wordy guy out of my head."
3/31/25 1:20:58a Babajaga thinks, "I am sorry.. they were in the open view."
3/31/25 1:20:58a Urgelt thinks, "a frank discussion might be of value, Tenebrion."
3/31/25 1:20:58a Chitra says, "he gots Pendant"
3/31/25 1:20:58a J'nder says, "lets go scrag the bastard"

3/31/25 1:20:58a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Puddleby: 01 Tenebrion: 00 Darshak: 00"
3/31/25 1:21:00a Odesseus thinks, "who is this Frank?"
3/31/25 1:21:00a Terenas says, "actually we have invaded many times"
3/31/25 1:21:00a Tenebrion thinks, "What do you wish to discuss?"
3/31/25 1:21:01a Chitra says, "we no deal with DK's fast enough...."
3/31/25 1:21:01a Terenas thinks, "The arrangements of our deal"
3/31/25 1:21:02a Chitra says, "only two hitters"
3/31/25 1:21:02a (Odesseus nods)
3/31/25 1:21:02a Tigger ponders, "I once had a girlfriend with a car named Frank."
3/31/25 1:21:02a Urgelt thinks, "Establishing positive relations, for one thing. Smithing, for another."
3/31/25 1:21:02a Bon Temps asks, "passes?"
3/31/25 1:21:03a Tessa exclaims, "heee!"
3/31/25 1:21:03a Odesseus says, "I kin only hit em oncest inna while"
3/31/25 1:21:04a Chitra says, "me also"
3/31/25 1:21:04a Tessa asks, "Frank is such a prankster isn't he?"
3/31/25 1:21:05a Babajaga thinks, "Please, don´t make haste. I´ll find those notes exiles.."
3/31/25 1:21:05a Tigger says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:21:05a Terenas says, "Urgelt, Tenebrion seems akin to dipplomacy too"
3/31/25 1:21:05a (J'nder smiles.)
3/31/25 1:21:07a Terenas says, "er diplomacy"
3/31/25 1:21:07a Tenebrion thinks, "I would like to discuss Virgil. Perhaps you could offer his services for my smith."
3/31/25 1:21:07a Haenk says, "i dont trust him"
3/31/25 1:21:08a Tigger yells, "farh Come to the west of town"
3/31/25 1:21:08a J'nder thinks, "her"
3/31/25 1:21:10a Haenk asks, "remember the "need more corpses" part?"
3/31/25 1:21:10a Tigger says, "ppHate it when that happens"
3/31/25 1:21:10a Mac-arena yells, "where cor?"
3/31/25 1:21:11a Terenas thinks, "Well you have our pendants, why not keep half your part of the deal, and then we'll keep our other half"
3/31/25 1:21:11a Chitra says, "hrmm"
3/31/25 1:21:42a Chitra says, "I no ken read yer diary >^-^<"
3/31/25 1:21:44a Tenebrion thinks, "I paid fairly for the pendant."
3/31/25 1:21:44a Farhope yells, "Hear the winds of dawn!"
3/31/25 1:21:44a J'nder asks, "where did he get the pendant from?"
3/31/25 1:21:45a Odesseus says, "oh, is down right now"
3/31/25 1:21:45a Natas thinks, "you didnt give your smith services to the foolish ones who gave you a pendant your a fraud and a liar"
3/31/25 1:21:45a Chitra says, "I dunno"
3/31/25 1:21:45a Tigger asks, "Babaj yer diary is unlocked now?"
3/31/25 1:21:46a Odesseus says, ":"/"
3/31/25 1:21:47a Tessa ponders, "What's a pendant? I don't have a clue what they are talking about."
3/31/25 1:21:49a Chitra says, "I not outa liberry when Exiles give it to him"
3/31/25 1:21:50a Urgelt thinks, "not all are suited to smithing."
3/31/25 1:21:50a Terenas thinks, "Come to Puddleby, we will receive you Tenebrion without animosity"
3/31/25 1:21:51a J'nder shows her Purgatory pendant to everyone.
3/31/25 1:21:51a Koraleva says, "tessa pendant is for purgatory..."
3/31/25 1:21:52a Chitra says, "I hear 'bouts it when I leave"
3/31/25 1:21:52a Odesseus says, "me neiver"
3/31/25 1:21:53a J'nder says, "one of there"
3/31/25 1:21:53a Tessa asks, "What does that do?"
3/31/25 1:21:53a Chris Rex exclaims, "HOPEY!"
3/31/25 1:21:53a Tigger says, "Hullo Farhope"
3/31/25 1:21:54a Koraleva says, "well he has one..."
3/31/25 1:22:00a You slaughtered a Rat.
3/31/25 1:22:01a Farhope says, "Greetings"
3/31/25 1:22:01a Tigger says, ":-}"
3/31/25 1:22:04a Mac-arena yells, "who'll come to Fire Island with me on a mapping expedition?"
3/31/25 1:22:05a Haenk says, "hi farhope :)"
3/31/25 1:22:05a Farhope asks, "problems?"
3/31/25 1:22:05a Tigger says, "Well...there WAS stuff to kill here..."
3/31/25 1:22:06a Babajaga thinks, "Tenebrion. if I may ask.. what does this mean..: to continue... ..need more fresh... ...healthy bodies.."
3/31/25 1:22:06a Chitra says, "it give access to Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:22:06a Haenk says, "not any more"
3/31/25 1:22:07a Bon Temps thinks, "Tenebrion, you should untrain and become a healer. <G>"
3/31/25 1:22:07a (Farhope smiles)
3/31/25 1:22:08a Mac-arena asks, "coda?"
3/31/25 1:22:08a Odesseus says, "oh, no... no problems"
3/31/25 1:22:08a J'nder says, "allows the user to teleport to purgatory"
3/31/25 1:22:08a Koraleva says, "you can go in and out"
3/31/25 1:22:09a Tenebrion thinks, "Discuss a trade amongst yourselves along the lines of Virgil and my smith. Contact me when you are ready."
3/31/25 1:22:09a Terenas thinks, "Tenebrion bring your swith as well"
3/31/25 1:22:10a Tessa asks, "To where?"
3/31/25 1:22:11a Koraleva says, "instead of falling or whatever..."
3/31/25 1:22:12a Chitra says, "Purgatory... some sorta Artifact"
3/31/25 1:22:12a Terenas says, "lol"
3/31/25 1:22:22a (Mac-arena the Bored Zo looks around for people to help him complete his map)
3/31/25 1:22:22a Terenas says, "i cant type"
3/31/25 1:22:22a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Nah, not enough coinwhorage hunting with you Mac0a"
3/31/25 1:22:25a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Nah, not enough coinwhorage hunting with you Mac-a"
3/31/25 1:22:25a Haenk thinks, "then where is "your smith""
3/31/25 1:22:25a Odesseus says, "cloudy floaty place"
3/31/25 1:22:25a Urgelt says, "he will not answer."
3/31/25 1:22:26a Chitra says, "we not sure who make it"
3/31/25 1:22:27a Terenas thinks, "We are ready and waiting, and that was smith:)"
3/31/25 1:22:27a Tigger says, "Only problem was Odes thrying to sketch while he fights"
3/31/25 1:22:27a Mac-arena exclaims, "we get to kill Darshak, and kitties!"
3/31/25 1:22:28a Tessa says, "I've never been there but it DOESN'T sound like a nice place."
3/31/25 1:22:31a Urgelt asks, "what is the harm of letting him train with Virgil?"
3/31/25 1:22:32a Chris Rex yells, "the sandman calls... be well all!!!"
3/31/25 1:22:32a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Ig Agoob tagged along I would but..."
3/31/25 1:22:32a Babajaga says, "Please Urgelt. Read the deciphered message before you make any decisions"
3/31/25 1:22:33a Chitra says, "but.. is parta why is so hard to die here"
3/31/25 1:22:33a Mac-arena yells, "bye chris"
3/31/25 1:22:33a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "If Agoob tagged along I would but..."
3/31/25 1:22:33a Koraleva says, "its where you go if you depart"
3/31/25 1:22:33a Natas thinks, "yes id like to talk to your smith and cut oout the middleman namely YOU"
3/31/25 1:22:34a J'nder says, "for a start, he's not a healer"
3/31/25 1:22:35a Urgelt says, "I sense your view is that he is monstrous, Baba."
3/31/25 1:22:35a Chitra says, "no.. he a Necromancer"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Terenas says, "no"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Tessa ponders, "Oh it's the dwarf again."
3/31/25 1:22:36a Koraleva says, "he's a pain in the ass is what he is"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Terenas says, "he employs the darshak"
3/31/25 1:22:36a J'nder says, "and I doubt Master Hekus will allow him egress"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Urgelt asks, "not so?"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Babajaga says, "I fear what he might be. And what he might use the pendant for"
3/31/25 1:22:36a Mac-arena yells, "anyone to help me map the Fire Island beaches?"
3/31/25 1:22:37a Odesseus thinks to you, "so what the RQ story?"
3/31/25 1:22:37a (Urgelt nods.)
3/31/25 1:22:38a Terenas says, "he owns a castle, and controls an island, he is more like a warlord"
3/31/25 1:22:39a Babajaga says, "This is what we found.."
3/31/25 1:22:42a You concentrate on sending your message to Odesseus.
3/31/25 1:22:42a Mac-arena says, "farhope, only need a few minutes"
3/31/25 1:22:48a Tigger asks, "Did the mirror ever reappear?"
3/31/25 1:22:48a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "He is a High Status Necromancer"
3/31/25 1:22:51a Farhope says, "ok, I go with you then"
3/31/25 1:22:52a Chitra says, "he gots lotta undead in his "service""
3/31/25 1:22:52a Mac-arena asks, "okie... anyone else?"
3/31/25 1:22:52a Odesseus thinks to you, "ah, okie"
3/31/25 1:22:52a J'nder says, "I still think he's a necromancer"
3/31/25 1:22:52a Terenas says, "Urge he can employ greater deaths"
3/31/25 1:22:53a Babajaga yells, "I will read what we found in his keep"
3/31/25 1:22:53a Urgelt says, "seems so."
3/31/25 1:22:53a Tigger asks, "Anyone ever get back to castle?"
3/31/25 1:22:53a Babajaga says, "On his scrolls"
3/31/25 1:22:53a Babajaga says, "crystal shines... ...complete star... ...the path."
3/31/25 1:22:53a Chitra says, "he a Necromancer"
3/31/25 1:22:53a Terenas says, "could doestroy us very easily"
3/31/25 1:22:53a (Odesseus is a Bonkomancer)
3/31/25 1:22:54a Urgelt says, "Baba, please do."
3/31/25 1:22:54a Babajaga says, "my efforts... ...miserable failures... ...to return life."
3/31/25 1:22:54a Koraleva says, "time for study"
3/31/25 1:22:55a Babajaga says, ".secret to prevent... ...diseased minds... ..eludes me."
3/31/25 1:22:55a Terenas thinks, "Tenebrion we are waiting for you"
3/31/25 1:22:56a Chitra ponders, "yaar.. I read dis part"
3/31/25 1:22:56a Babajaga says, "And here it comes"
3/31/25 1:22:56a Babajaga says, ".to continue... ..need more fresh... ...healthy bodies."
3/31/25 1:22:56a Haenk ponders, "the "corpses" part"
3/31/25 1:22:56a (Koraleva waves')
3/31/25 1:22:57a Babajaga says, "intelligent behavior... ...mere instinct... ...only semblance."
3/31/25 1:22:57a Chitra says, "also is part 'bout minds"
3/31/25 1:22:58a Urgelt says, "and some of us have seen his meat locker."
3/31/25 1:22:58a Tigger says, "Well there's a whole heap of fresh ones right here...come and get it."
3/31/25 1:22:58a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "and he's got a fridge at the end of his ramparts"
3/31/25 1:22:59a Chitra says, "OUR spirits travel through Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:22:59a Babajaga says, "And the last, on floor six"
3/31/25 1:23:00a Urgelt ponders, "I haven't, but others have."
3/31/25 1:23:00a Babajaga says, "We miss a healer message there"
3/31/25 1:23:00a Babajaga says, "transfer mind... ...dispose of body.."
3/31/25 1:23:00a Chitra says, "he wanna grab dem"
3/31/25 1:23:01a Urgelt says, "disturbing."
3/31/25 1:23:02a Babajaga exclaims, "I think that is pretty clear!"
3/31/25 1:23:02a Chitra says, "dat why he want Pendant"
3/31/25 1:23:02a J'nder says, "look If he has a pendant, and virgil training he'll just collect bodies from all our departees"
3/31/25 1:23:02a Odesseus says, "hrm"
3/31/25 1:23:03a Urgelt says, "thank you, Baba."
3/31/25 1:23:04a Urgelt says, "I think we have the information we need to decide."
3/31/25 1:23:04a Chitra says, "I no think he gonna need "virgil""
3/31/25 1:23:04a Tigger asks, "We do?"
3/31/25 1:23:05a Terenas asks, "what if he kidnaps virgil?"
3/31/25 1:23:05a Odesseus asks, "who Virgil?"
3/31/25 1:23:05a Haenk says, "no deal with him, whatsoever"
3/31/25 1:23:06a Urgelt says, "on the one hand, access to a smith trainer would be a fabulous bounty for Puddleby."
3/31/25 1:23:06a (Babajaga nods)
3/31/25 1:23:07a Tigger says, "You mean for FIGHTERS in Puddleby."
3/31/25 1:23:08a Chitra says, "Virgil person who teach Healers to use Pendant"
3/31/25 1:23:08a Urgelt says, "on the other, granting him what he desires carries with it great risk..."
3/31/25 1:23:08a Sagramor ponders, "he'll manage to get it somehow, might as well get something for it"
3/31/25 1:23:09a Odesseus says, "ah ha"
3/31/25 1:23:09a J'nder says, "4th Circle healer quarters is heavily enchanted"
3/31/25 1:23:09a Terenas says, "I agree with sagramor"
3/31/25 1:23:10a Urgelt says, "of furthering some very nasty schemes indeed."
3/31/25 1:23:10a Chitra says, "if Tenebrion compromises Purgatory..."
3/31/25 1:23:10a Odesseus says, "Dunno, tigg, mebbe for everybody"
3/31/25 1:23:11a Sagramor says, "we didnt give him a pendant, yet he now has one"
3/31/25 1:23:11a Tigger says, "Perhaps..."
3/31/25 1:23:11a Chitra says, "den we no gonna be able to Depart again"
3/31/25 1:23:12a Chitra says, "EVER"
3/31/25 1:23:12a Urgelt says, "as much as I hunger for smithing, I will not be a part of helping him."
3/31/25 1:23:12a Babajaga asks, "Remember what Minx said?"
3/31/25 1:23:12a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Someone sold him one"
3/31/25 1:23:13a J'nder says, "exactly Chitra"
3/31/25 1:23:13a Odesseus exclaims, "erf!"
3/31/25 1:23:13a Chitra says, "we need to talk to Minx"
3/31/25 1:23:13a Tigger says, "Well if I can buy a super dagger then maybe..."
3/31/25 1:23:14a Chitra says, "Minx prolly kin answer"
3/31/25 1:23:14a J'nder says, "if he's telling the truth"
3/31/25 1:23:14a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "there is a 12,000c. bounty on them, or so I hear"
3/31/25 1:23:14a Terenas says, "Urge"
3/31/25 1:23:15a Babajaga says, "Minx said.. as I recall"
3/31/25 1:23:15a Odesseus says, "ya, if you kin find him"
3/31/25 1:23:15a Urgelt says, "I have not spoken to Minx in a very very long time."
3/31/25 1:23:15a Terenas says, "I sitll think we can get the smithy"
3/31/25 1:23:16a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "I have not heard who"
3/31/25 1:23:16a J'nder says, "we have no proof he has a pendant"
3/31/25 1:23:17a Chitra says, "Althea spoke to Minx 'bouts a year ago.. .(IC)"
3/31/25 1:23:17a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "only of the bounty ffor them"
3/31/25 1:23:17a Thuja says, "He does, Jnder"
3/31/25 1:23:17a (Odesseus nods)
3/31/25 1:23:18a Tigger asks, "Who said he had a pendant? He did?"
3/31/25 1:23:19a Terenas says, "Have him uphold his part of the deal now, and we will in time"
3/31/25 1:23:19a Chitra says, "Minx say he comin' back.. to chat agin.. 'bout now"
3/31/25 1:23:19a Odesseus says, "was given to him, J'nder"
3/31/25 1:23:28a Thuja says, "I know who gave it to him."
3/31/25 1:23:31a Chitra says, "Minx say (then) he comin' back.. to chat agin.. 'bout now"
3/31/25 1:23:31a J'nder asks, "who?"
3/31/25 1:23:33a Odesseus says, "ahh"
3/31/25 1:23:34a Thuja says, "I'm not sure I should tell."
3/31/25 1:23:35a Tigger ponders, "tell tell"
3/31/25 1:23:35a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Someone sold him a pendant, the person admitted to doing so, I do not know who, but only that there is a 12,000c. bounty on their head"
3/31/25 1:23:36a Chitra says, "also he says force dat keep us frum dyin' her onna island..."
3/31/25 1:23:37a •You gain experience.
3/31/25 1:23:38a J'nder asks, "if it was done openly, then why not tell?"
3/31/25 1:23:39a Chitra says, "also he says force dat keep us frum dyin' here onna island..."
3/31/25 1:23:39a Thuja says, "They would be lynched."
3/31/25 1:23:53a Chitra says, "is gittin' weaker"
3/31/25 1:23:55a Terenas says, "not really"
3/31/25 1:23:56a Thuja says, "But they are good people."
3/31/25 1:23:56a Haenk says, "nah"
3/31/25 1:23:57a Odesseus says, "heard that Chitra"
3/31/25 1:23:57a Tigger asks, "Lynchings are good...who is it?"
3/31/25 1:23:57a Terenas says, "Thuja they wont"
3/31/25 1:23:58a Chitra says, "he say his brotherhood investigatin' it"
3/31/25 1:24:00a Chitra says, "but dey no unnerstand"
3/31/25 1:24:01a Terenas says, "if it does that much damage"
3/31/25 1:24:01a (J'nder guesses)
3/31/25 1:24:01a Odesseus says, "I reember... said it made him worried"
3/31/25 1:24:03a Terenas says, "then the person responcible would feel badly enough"
3/31/25 1:24:03a Tigger asks, "Don;t they deserve to by lynched?"
3/31/25 1:24:03a Urgelt says, "I myself would have given a pendant for access to a smith trainer, before Baba's revelations."
3/31/25 1:24:04a Terenas says, "then the person responsible would feel badly enough"
3/31/25 1:24:04a Urgelt says, "now, I would not."
3/31/25 1:24:04a Terenas says, "We would have all done it"
3/31/25 1:24:04a Haenk says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:24:05a Chitra says, "Pendant powerful thing"
3/31/25 1:24:05a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Thuja knows who sold Tenebrion the pendant"
3/31/25 1:24:06a Thuja says, "No, J"
3/31/25 1:24:06a Terenas says, "Easy CyrrilCoFei"
3/31/25 1:24:06a Achates says, "I think he means to invade through Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:24:07a Chitra says, "we treat it causually...."
3/31/25 1:24:08a Natas thinks, "sun wyrm in RC come and get it"
3/31/25 1:24:08a Cyrril Co'Fei asks, "Who then Terenas?"
3/31/25 1:24:08a Urgelt says, "I think he is indifferent to us."
3/31/25 1:24:08a Babajaga says, "I think its much.. much worse than that"
3/31/25 1:24:08a Urgelt says, "invasion is not his goal."
3/31/25 1:24:08a Tigger says, "Darn, that means all the mystics will die first."
3/31/25 1:24:08a Achates exclaims, "if one controls Purgatory, He controls Puddleby!"
3/31/25 1:24:09a Geotzou thinks, "all healers to rocky cavern please, and fighters too ;-)"
3/31/25 1:24:09a Chitra says, "but .. is access tool fer strange and powerful artifact"
3/31/25 1:24:09a Terenas says, "That is what we are trying to find out"
3/31/25 1:24:09a (Urgelt nods to Babajaga.)
3/31/25 1:24:19a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Tigger - LOL"
3/31/25 1:24:21a Chitra says, "no.. it ain'"
3/31/25 1:24:21a Chitra says, "no.. it ain't"
3/31/25 1:24:23a Chitra says, "he jest want our souls I think"
3/31/25 1:24:23a Urgelt says, "with his knowledge and the pendant's magic at his disposal..."
3/31/25 1:24:24a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "We'll bne rid of Malkor, wheeeee!!! ;D"
3/31/25 1:24:24a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "We'll be rid of Malkor, wheeeee!!! ;D"
3/31/25 1:24:24a Tigger ponders, "yay!"
3/31/25 1:24:24a Urgelt says, "he may be able to divert the magics that sustain us."
3/31/25 1:24:24a Chitra says, "he jest want to use us a ... fodder"
3/31/25 1:24:25a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:24:25a Tigger ponders, ":-P"
3/31/25 1:24:25a Urgelt says, "moonstone magic."
3/31/25 1:24:26a Chitra says, "dat possible too"
3/31/25 1:24:26a Urgelt says, "Adytum."
3/31/25 1:24:26a (J'nder nods)
3/31/25 1:24:26a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "and Aki and Sutai, crazy mystics...."
3/31/25 1:24:27a Terenas asks, "Urge what if he could control where we pop out of purg? Right into his dungeon?"
3/31/25 1:24:27a Odesseus asks, "fodder? what about mudder?"
3/31/25 1:24:27a Tigger says, "They all nuts."
3/31/25 1:24:28a Babajaga exclaims, "Its even worse Terenas !"
3/31/25 1:24:28a Tessa says, "Well there's always "old fashioned" medicine."
3/31/25 1:24:28a Chitra says, "I no here when Hekus repair th' Altar..."
3/31/25 1:24:28a Terenas says, "This could be another massive war"
3/31/25 1:24:28a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "But den we lose Phiros =("
3/31/25 1:24:29a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Phiros not nuts =("
3/31/25 1:24:30a Urgelt says, "I think that's the least of our concerns, though it's serious enough in its own right, Terenas."
3/31/25 1:24:30a Achates says, "He should not be allowed to see Virgil"
3/31/25 1:24:31a Odesseus says, "I was here... wotta mess"
3/31/25 1:24:31a Tigger says, "So ok let's say he gets everyone's souls? What would he do? He'd be totally bored."
3/31/25 1:24:31a Babajaga says, "Hear me out."
3/31/25 1:24:31a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "here here Acha"
3/31/25 1:24:32a (Thuja's sunstone glows for a brief moment.)
3/31/25 1:24:32a J'nder thinks, "anyone with Peet?"
3/31/25 1:24:32a Urgelt says, "I doubt his goals have anything to do with us, directly."
3/31/25 1:24:32a (Chitra listens)
3/31/25 1:24:32a Tessa ponders, "But... she's nearly insane!"
3/31/25 1:24:33a Odesseus says, "heh, Tigg"
3/31/25 1:24:33a (Thuja's sunstone glows for a brief moment.)
3/31/25 1:24:33a Babajaga says, "It´s like this: If we give him the access to Virgil, he will have control IN Purgatory."
3/31/25 1:24:33a (Cyrril Co'Fei): HWC eats some cookies
3/31/25 1:24:34a (Thuja's sunstone glows for a brief moment.)
3/31/25 1:24:34a Terenas says, "'cept we are in his way"
3/31/25 1:24:34a Achates says, "exactly"
3/31/25 1:24:36a Achates says, "got Purg, you got Puddleby eventually"
3/31/25 1:24:36a Urgelt says, "a stepping stone only, Baba, I think."
3/31/25 1:24:36a Babajaga says, "meaning that he controls our way to purg, the magic that keeps us from dying"
3/31/25 1:24:37a (Urgelt nods.)
3/31/25 1:24:37a Chitra says, "I think if he gots total access to our Purgatory... we totally screwed"
3/31/25 1:24:38a Babajaga says, "With that, he will also control the magic itself"
3/31/25 1:24:39a Urgelt says, "that's my fear as well."
3/31/25 1:24:39a Achates exclaims, "do not allow this to happen!"
3/31/25 1:24:40a Haenk says, "he only needs to steal the altar then"
3/31/25 1:24:40a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Aye"
3/31/25 1:24:40a Babajaga says, "No..."
3/31/25 1:24:41a Terenas says, "Like I said, he is a control freak, a war lrod"
3/31/25 1:24:41a Achates says, "He must not see Virgil"
3/31/25 1:24:42a Terenas says, "Like I said, he is a control freak, a war lord"
3/31/25 1:24:42a (Urgelt nods to Terenas.)
3/31/25 1:24:42a Babajaga says, "Bartok showed us that this is not enough"
3/31/25 1:24:42a Terenas says, "we should use that against him"
3/31/25 1:24:43a Chitra says, "Altar is tool... is not purgatory"
3/31/25 1:24:43a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Tenebrion must not see Virgil"
3/31/25 1:24:43a Terenas says, "They are very easily upsetted"
3/31/25 1:24:43a Tigger is sharing experiences with you.
3/31/25 1:24:44a Haenk asks, "but a pendant & the altar & his knowledge?"
3/31/25 1:24:44a Chitra says, "is critically important tool.. but.."
3/31/25 1:24:44a (Chitra shrugs)
3/31/25 1:24:44a Urgelt asks, "are we agreed?"
3/31/25 1:24:44a Terenas says, "He has no real army, accept the darshak he employs"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Chitra says, "Altar heavy"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Haenk says, "im afraid of this combination"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Odesseus ponders, "is big an heavy"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "If he gets the Altar"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Babajaga says, "if we give in to Tenebrion, we are opening up for death."
3/31/25 1:24:45a Urgelt asks, "Tenebrion shall not be permitted to see Virgil?"
3/31/25 1:24:45a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "when we depart..."
3/31/25 1:24:45a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "we will pop back to altar!"
3/31/25 1:24:46a Achates exclaims, "Yes!!!"
3/31/25 1:24:46a Chitra says, "Tenebrion no gots physical strength of Bartok I no think"
3/31/25 1:24:46a Terenas says, "aye, he shant"
3/31/25 1:24:46a Tigger asks, "How can you prevent it?"
3/31/25 1:24:46a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "he could put altar in lava pool and we'd be screwed!!!"
3/31/25 1:24:47a Odesseus says, "other altars"
3/31/25 1:24:47a Babajaga says, "I think we need to know more before we decide."
3/31/25 1:24:47a Terenas says, "For all we know he would take his abilities and kill him"
3/31/25 1:24:47a Odesseus says, "on theives isle\"
3/31/25 1:24:48a Babajaga says, "On the other hand..."
3/31/25 1:24:48a Chitra says, "other Altars in Isles.. for show only"
3/31/25 1:24:48a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Actually, there's 3"
3/31/25 1:24:48a Urgelt says, "I think we shall not be granted specific information about his true goals."
3/31/25 1:24:49a Urgelt says, "he will attempt to deceive us."
3/31/25 1:24:49a Odesseus says, "one in Agratis"
3/31/25 1:24:49a Babajaga says, "Perhaps.."
3/31/25 1:24:49a Urgelt says, "some will believe, and we will be divided."
3/31/25 1:24:49a Achates says, "as he already has"
3/31/25 1:24:50a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Aye, the fire is an Altar"
3/31/25 1:24:50a Babajaga says, "Again."
3/31/25 1:24:50a Odesseus ponders, "sorta hidden"
3/31/25 1:24:50a Urgelt says, "let us be resolved."
3/31/25 1:24:50a (Odesseus nods)
3/31/25 1:24:50a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "It USED to be a secret =)"
3/31/25 1:24:50a Chitra says, "but dey no work when Main Altar stolen Ode"
3/31/25 1:24:51a Urgelt says, "this man dabbles in the darkest arts."
3/31/25 1:24:51a (Cyrril Co'Fei discovered it)
3/31/25 1:24:51a Babajaga says, "One thing I wonder.."
3/31/25 1:24:51a Urgelt says, "he is a menace."
3/31/25 1:24:51a Achates says, "I have always been untrustworthy of such brutality"
3/31/25 1:24:51a Odesseus asks, "really?"
3/31/25 1:24:52a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Yup"
3/31/25 1:24:52a Odesseus ponders, "erf"
3/31/25 1:24:52a Chitra says, "really"
3/31/25 1:24:52a Odesseus says, "that a pain"
3/31/25 1:24:52a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "back in... v90 summin"
3/31/25 1:24:53a Terenas says, "well we firstly need to find his exact location"
3/31/25 1:24:53a Babajaga says, "We will not be able to control all exiles."
3/31/25 1:24:54a Urgelt says, "I believe the magic of Adytum, Purgatory, and the altars is fragile."
3/31/25 1:24:54a Terenas says, "Then we need to simply take the war to his own land"
3/31/25 1:24:54a Tigger says, "We survived without an altar once, we can again. And maybe this time we get giant Fen head on the new one."
3/31/25 1:24:54a Chitra says, "no.. we won't"
3/31/25 1:24:54a Babajaga says, "I fear someone will let him see Virgil"
3/31/25 1:24:55a Urgelt says, "it can be disrupted."
3/31/25 1:24:55a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Who here bets that "The Valley" we tested a while back will be the new route to tenebrions keep ;D"
3/31/25 1:24:55a (Chitra sighs)
3/31/25 1:24:55a Urgelt says, "we have seen this is so in the Ripture War."
3/31/25 1:24:55a Odesseus ponders, "Adytum? that still around?"
3/31/25 1:24:55a Terenas says, "He has a very complex maze that he built, which is to prevent us from reaching what he has at the end"
3/31/25 1:24:56a Chitra says, "well.. den we need to TALK to Virgil"
3/31/25 1:24:56a Achates says, "doubtful to get any 4th • healers to guard him"
3/31/25 1:24:56a Urgelt says, "Adytum remains. Our access to it is gone."
3/31/25 1:24:56a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Who here bets that "The Valley" we tested a while back will be the new route to tenebrions keep ;D"
3/31/25 1:24:56a Haenk says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:24:57a Chitra says, "we need to tell Virgil to not train him..."
3/31/25 1:24:57a Terenas says, "He has a very complex maze that he built, which is to prevent us from reaching what he has at the end"
3/31/25 1:24:57a Babajaga asks, "I fear someone will let him see Virgil. Maybe it´s best still to let him see him in a controlled.. environment?"
3/31/25 1:24:57a Chitra says, "or more to th' point.. we need to tell Hekus"
3/31/25 1:24:57a • It's Midnight on Sombdi, the 22nd day of Summer in the 539th year of the Ascendancy, and all's well.
3/31/25 1:24:57a Haenk says, "no 4• should ever let him into there"
3/31/25 1:24:57a Tigger says, "I missed this "Valley""
3/31/25 1:24:57a Sagramor ponders, "Indeed, ask Virgil of her views"
3/31/25 1:24:58a Haenk says, "ill go & ask"
3/31/25 1:24:58a Terenas says, "Not even that"
3/31/25 1:24:58a Odesseus asks, "Valley? Maze?"
3/31/25 1:24:58a Urgelt says, "he either trains, or does not, that is our only control."
3/31/25 1:24:59a Terenas says, "I'm sure he could easily distract us with an invasion"
3/31/25 1:24:59a Urgelt says, "if we admit him, he will train."
3/31/25 1:25:00a Chitra says, "Hekus no liked folks messin' with th' altar.. or with Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:25:00a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Ode - we tested for HGM mid sept. a place she called "The Valley""
3/31/25 1:25:00a Babajaga says, "I am not so sure we can control that , since we cant control all exiles"
3/31/25 1:25:00a Odesseus ponders, "we are outcasts... *someone* will be corruted"
3/31/25 1:25:00a Thuja thinks, "Peet up in savannah"
3/31/25 1:25:00a Chitra says, "hrmm..."
3/31/25 1:25:01a Terenas says, "I dont even know if the doorman will let him in:)"
3/31/25 1:25:01a Urgelt says, "we must do what we can."
3/31/25 1:25:01a Chitra says, "well.. I think Tenebrion need invatation"
3/31/25 1:25:01a Urgelt says, "and pray it is enough."
3/31/25 1:25:02a Achates savors a rich dark chocolate vermine.
3/31/25 1:25:02a Babajaga asks, "Why don´t we meet him face to face?"
3/31/25 1:25:02a Urgelt thinks, "Tenebrion, do you hear?"
3/31/25 1:25:02a Tigger ponders, "mmm"
3/31/25 1:25:03a Tenebrion thinks, "I am listening."
3/31/25 1:25:03a (Cyrril Co'Fei salivates and stares at Acah)
3/31/25 1:25:03a Urgelt says, "that is acceptable."
3/31/25 1:25:03a Odesseus says, "hard to get to him"
3/31/25 1:25:03a (Cyrril Co'Fei salivates and stares at Acha)
3/31/25 1:25:03a Terenas says, "That is what I said, lets take him out"
3/31/25 1:25:03a Chitra says, "he kinda control issue"
3/31/25 1:25:04a Tigger asks, "Who are we taking out?"
3/31/25 1:25:04a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:25:04a Babajaga says, "No terenas.. hold your anger.."
3/31/25 1:25:04a Odesseus says, "Tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:25:04a Rcooka-e says, "(:"
3/31/25 1:25:04a Urgelt thinks, "Tenebrion, we are willing to meet face to face. We are not willing to grant access to Virgil."
3/31/25 1:25:04a Babajaga says, "lets be clever.."
3/31/25 1:25:05a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:25:05a Tigger asks, "3Oh> How do you propose we go about that?"
3/31/25 1:25:05a Cyrril Co'Fei asks, "BTW, Tiggz, like me new duds?"
3/31/25 1:25:05a Chitra says, "best we see what he wants"
3/31/25 1:25:05a Odesseus ponders, "Baba humming again"
3/31/25 1:25:06a Tigger says, "Sweet Cyrril"
3/31/25 1:25:06a Urgelt says, "bah, cleverness fools the clever, let's be honest."
3/31/25 1:25:06a Babajaga asks, "Where would be a suitable place for a meeting?"
3/31/25 1:25:06a (Terenas nods)
3/31/25 1:25:07a Achates says, "the dock"
3/31/25 1:25:07a (Cyrril Co'Fei is irresistable, not that he wasn't before but...)
3/31/25 1:25:07a (Achates chuckles.)
3/31/25 1:25:07a (Tigger dangles som blueberry pie over Cyrril's new duds.)
3/31/25 1:25:07a J'nder thinks, "access to Virgil is up to the healer masters"
3/31/25 1:25:07a (Tigger dangles some blueberry pie over Cyrril's new duds.)
3/31/25 1:25:07a (Cyrril Co'Fei shrieks)
3/31/25 1:25:08a Terenas says, "if he is a threat to us, why solve all our problems right now"
3/31/25 1:25:08a Chitra says, "th' area beyond th' mirror.. before th' poppy field >^-^<"
3/31/25 1:25:08a Odesseus says, "hehe"
3/31/25 1:25:08a Odesseus ponders, "Mean ol Tigg"
3/31/25 1:25:09a Babajaga says, "We could meet at the docks.."
3/31/25 1:25:09a Terenas says, "possibly prevent a war"
3/31/25 1:25:09a (Cyrril Co'Fei mixes something up in a small bowl)
3/31/25 1:25:09a Tenebrion thinks, "I will send an emmisary when I deem it is safe for him."
3/31/25 1:25:09a Urgelt says, "I think we stand in his way."
3/31/25 1:25:10a Tigger ponders, "That's nothin...think of the blood spatters..."
3/31/25 1:25:10a Terenas says, "ok lets not kill his emissary"
3/31/25 1:25:10a Babajaga exclaims, "Noo tell him to meet in person!"
3/31/25 1:25:10a Chitra thinks, "what conditions you consider safe?"
3/31/25 1:25:10a Odesseus ponders, "emmisary?"
3/31/25 1:25:10a Terenas says, "=)"
3/31/25 1:25:10a Geotzou thinks, "we need some more help for rocky cavern please.,"
3/31/25 1:25:11a Terenas says, "er"
3/31/25 1:25:11a (Cyrril Co'Fei applies the mixture over his clothing)
3/31/25 1:25:11a Achates asks, "what does he really want then?"
3/31/25 1:25:11a J'nder thinks, "we CAN grant a safe conduct"
3/31/25 1:25:11a Terenas says, "oh baba"
3/31/25 1:25:11a Babajaga exclaims, "He has to meet in person!"
3/31/25 1:25:11a Urgelt says, "an emmisary is fine."
3/31/25 1:25:11a Terenas asks, "you know what he means by safe right?"
3/31/25 1:25:11a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "I will Emissary"
3/31/25 1:25:12a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "I will Emissary"
3/31/25 1:25:12a Terenas says, "he is going to send something to kill us all then when we are all dead"
3/31/25 1:25:12a Tenebrion thinks, "Last time I sent a representative he was followed back by an invasion force of your people."
3/31/25 1:25:12a Urgelt says, "he means to send one to us."
3/31/25 1:25:12a Tigger asks, "Who's dumb en....er...brave enough for that job?"
3/31/25 1:25:12a Urgelt says, "not the reverse."
3/31/25 1:25:12a Terenas says, "he will presume it safe"
3/31/25 1:25:13a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Brave or Stupid, you decide!"
3/31/25 1:25:14a Achates asks, "what does he really want then?"
3/31/25 1:25:14a J'nder thinks, "not an invasion force, your guard attacked without warning"
3/31/25 1:25:14a (Farhope smiles)
3/31/25 1:25:14a Urgelt thinks, "I did not participate in that, and I will ask the citizens to refrain from it."
3/31/25 1:25:15a Tigger ponders, "I hope she disposed of Mac-Arena's body."
3/31/25 1:25:15a Tenebrion thinks, "When I deem it safe for my man to visit you, I shall send him."
3/31/25 1:25:15a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:25:15a Cyrril Co'Fei ponders, "=o"
3/31/25 1:25:16a (Chitra growls)
3/31/25 1:25:16a Terenas thinks, "Coward"
3/31/25 1:25:16a Babajaga thinks, "Why an emissary Tenebrion? It would gather more trust if you could meet us in person."
3/31/25 1:25:16a Urgelt thinks, "Tenebrion, what conditions would make you decide it's safe?"
3/31/25 1:25:17a Terenas thinks, "You will only deem it "safe" when we are all dead"
3/31/25 1:25:17a (Odesseus needs a nap)
3/31/25 1:25:18a Chitra says, "hush Terenas"
3/31/25 1:25:18a Achates says, "He wants Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:25:18a Babajaga says, "Shhh"
3/31/25 1:25:18a Terenas says, "It's true"
3/31/25 1:25:18a Achates says, "and its Power"
3/31/25 1:25:18a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "OOC: Download - DIO's song "Holy Diver" it kicks arse"
3/31/25 1:25:20a Tessa thinks, "Why don't you pick just one or a few of us then and lead that person to a place of your choosing?"
3/31/25 1:25:28a Babajaga thinks, "So... I gather the notes we found were yours then..."
3/31/25 1:25:30a Tenebrion thinks, "Perhaps I will do that."
3/31/25 1:25:35a Babajaga says, "I don´t trust him a minute. Yet."
3/31/25 1:25:35a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:25:35a Rcooka-e ponders, "maybe a mystic can locate that Tenebrion?"
3/31/25 1:25:36a Terenas says, "Don't trust him at all"
3/31/25 1:25:36a Tessa says, "Well it seems he has the next move."
3/31/25 1:25:37a Urgelt says, "if my hunch is correct, Baba, you never will."
3/31/25 1:25:37a Odesseus ponders, "lack of trust seems to be mutual"
3/31/25 1:25:37a (Tigger looks skeptical.)
3/31/25 1:25:37a Tessa ponders, "I'm not sure he had the previous one"
3/31/25 1:25:38a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "I don't trust him as far as I can pee"
3/31/25 1:25:39a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:25:39a Terenas says, "We'll never negotiate if we don't trust each other, also"
3/31/25 1:25:39a Tigger ponders, "I hope that is less far than this."
3/31/25 1:25:40a (Cyrril Co'Fei laugh)
3/31/25 1:25:40a (Babajaga scratches her neck thoughtfully)
3/31/25 1:25:40a (Cyrril Co'Fei laughs)
3/31/25 1:25:42a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Terenas - I can be overly trusting at times"
3/31/25 1:25:42a Odesseus ponders, "she's scratching her neck"
3/31/25 1:25:43a Terenas says, "Always:)"
3/31/25 1:25:44a (Cyrril Co'Fei yanks his shortsword Lifereaper™ out of its sheath on his side)
3/31/25 1:25:45a (Tigger feels a wormy tingle on his neck)
3/31/25 1:25:45a (Cyrril Co'Fei mumbles)
3/31/25 1:25:46a Chitra says, "hrmm"
3/31/25 1:25:46a Babajaga says, "Oh dear."
3/31/25 1:25:47a (Cyrril Co'Fei twirls his Axe menacingly)
3/31/25 1:25:47a Babajaga says, "I fear my visionstone cracked.."
3/31/25 1:25:48a Babajaga asks, "Anyone?"
3/31/25 1:25:48a Tigger says, "Hullo there Worm"
3/31/25 1:25:48a Chitra says, "ask who he gonna send"
3/31/25 1:25:48a Urgelt says, "sorry, didn't record."
3/31/25 1:25:49a (Babajaga looks around hopefully)
3/31/25 1:25:49a Terenas says, "He is just going to kill us then talk to us as corpses"
3/31/25 1:25:49a Chitra says, "I doin' it"
3/31/25 1:25:49a (Odesseus gets out his Shorsword MyrmDenter and waves it halfheartedly)
3/31/25 1:25:50a (Odesseus gets out his Shortsword MyrmDenter and waves it halfheartedly)
3/31/25 1:25:50a Terenas says, "Then he'll demand we deepart to show our ability to depart"
3/31/25 1:25:50a Babajaga says, "Ah good."
3/31/25 1:25:51a Terenas says, "Then he'll demand we depart to show our ability to depart"
3/31/25 1:25:51a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Baba, speak with Mac-arena, he always records"
3/31/25 1:25:51a Thuja thinks, "Come"
3/31/25 1:25:51a Chitra says, "Cyrril .. don't crowd folks"
3/31/25 1:25:52a Tessa thinks, "Who would you like to send, or receive then?"
3/31/25 1:25:52a Terenas says, "His emersary will be a greater death or something of that kind"
3/31/25 1:25:53a Odesseus says, "nice emmisary"
3/31/25 1:25:54a Terenas says, "It makes sense, its safe when no one is alive to kill him"
3/31/25 1:25:54a (Cyrril Co'Fei feels out of place up here and returns to his group of friends)
3/31/25 1:25:54a Urgelt says, "it's his move to make, Terenas."
3/31/25 1:25:54a Babajaga says, "I think we must demand that he meets us in person."
3/31/25 1:25:54a Terenas says, "It makes sense, it's safe when no one is alive to kill him"
3/31/25 1:25:55a Terenas says, "Exactly, we should make it our move"
3/31/25 1:25:55a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:25:55a Urgelt says, "that is a demand we can present to his emissary."
3/31/25 1:25:55a Tenebrion thinks, "I will consider the matter."
3/31/25 1:25:55a Babajaga says, "I agree."
3/31/25 1:25:56a Chitra says, "I think we gots to meet emissary first Baba"
3/31/25 1:25:56a Tessa asks, "How would you know it was him anyway?"
3/31/25 1:25:56a Tigger says, "Yes make your move. I be right behind you...really."
3/31/25 1:25:56a Terenas says, "Demand we want him, not an emersary, and we will not speak with his emersary"
3/31/25 1:25:56a Urgelt says, "we must start somewhere, or not start at all."
3/31/25 1:25:56a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "about 80 feet behind you"
3/31/25 1:25:57a (Tessa nods)
3/31/25 1:25:57a Terenas says, "We have started"
3/31/25 1:25:57a Tessa says, "I agree with the Dwarf on that point..."
3/31/25 1:25:57a Terenas says, "the direction it goes though..."
3/31/25 1:25:58a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Dok-tor ;D"
3/31/25 1:25:58a Urgelt says, "it's barely possible something positive could come from any discussion, Terenas."
3/31/25 1:25:58a (Terenas nods)
3/31/25 1:25:58a Urgelt says, "even with an emissary."
3/31/25 1:25:58a Chitra says, "he no gotta talk to us AT ALL Terenas"
3/31/25 1:25:58a Babajaga says, "We have something he wants. We have the upper hand."
3/31/25 1:25:59a Urgelt says, "we don't know WHY he is doing what he does."
3/31/25 1:25:59a Urgelt says, "if we knew that..."
3/31/25 1:25:59a Achates says, "we have many things he wants"
3/31/25 1:25:59a Odesseus ponders, "paw... upper paw"
3/31/25 1:26:00a Achates says, "notes, mist key, Purgatory"
3/31/25 1:26:00a Tigger ponders, ":-}"
3/31/25 1:26:00a Urgelt says, "perhaps there would be a way to help him that would not involve dark arts."
3/31/25 1:26:00a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:26:01a Achates says, "we must not be suckers"
3/31/25 1:26:01a Chitra says, "yaar.. we gots stuff he wants.. and he gotta DEAL with us to git'em"
3/31/25 1:26:01a Odesseus ponders, "indeed"
3/31/25 1:26:01a WormTounge ponders, "Mist key?"
3/31/25 1:26:01a Terenas says, "We also have the upperhand with the fact that we just drove back his army that he sent"
3/31/25 1:26:01a Urgelt says, "assuming his ultimate goal is positive."
3/31/25 1:26:01a Odesseus says, "paw, dammit"
3/31/25 1:26:02a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:26:02a Chitra says, "if he COULD just kill us and take what he wants.. he WOULD"
3/31/25 1:26:02a Babajaga says, "We are giving it away.."
3/31/25 1:26:02a Terenas says, "aye chitra"
3/31/25 1:26:03a Urgelt says, "if he's just a madman bent on utter destruction, nothing can be done, but we don't know that."
3/31/25 1:26:03a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Anyone interested in a 3-Pack of Peacetone Authentic Beer? Only 5c......."
3/31/25 1:26:03a Odesseus says, "so far we manage to rel him, thou"
3/31/25 1:26:03a Chitra says, "and mind you.. I think he CAN jest kill us"
3/31/25 1:26:04a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Anyone interested in a 3-Pack of Peaceton\ Authentic Beer? Only 5c......."
3/31/25 1:26:04a Odesseus says, "so far we manage to repel him, thou"
3/31/25 1:26:04a Urgelt says, "I think he cannot."
3/31/25 1:26:04a Chitra says, "so dere more to it den dat"
3/31/25 1:26:04a Babajaga says, "We are in a position to demand things. To declare that if he wants to talk to us, he needs to come himself"
3/31/25 1:26:05a Urgelt says, "the magic of Adytum, Purgatory, the altars, moonstones."
3/31/25 1:26:05a Terenas says, "that is what I have been trying to say:)"
3/31/25 1:26:06a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Anyone interested in a 3-Pack of Peaceton Authentic Beer? Only 5c......."
3/31/25 1:26:06a (Urgelt nods.)
3/31/25 1:26:06a Terenas says, "I don't think he has the capacity to conquer us"
3/31/25 1:26:06a Odesseus says, "heh"
3/31/25 1:26:06a Chitra says, "right"
3/31/25 1:26:06a Urgelt says, "we are not easily removed."
3/31/25 1:26:06a Thuja thinks, "Come"
3/31/25 1:26:07a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "savings of 1c.!!!"
3/31/25 1:26:07a Urgelt says, "we can be defeated, certainly, but not destroyed."
3/31/25 1:26:07a Chitra says, "but dat different den jest squishin' us"
3/31/25 1:26:07a Terenas says, "It will take more then some futile soldiers and 2 banshees as well"
3/31/25 1:26:08a Odesseus ponders, "3 banshees"
3/31/25 1:26:08a Terenas says, "3:)"
3/31/25 1:26:08a WormTounge asks, "What if Banshee had moonstones tho?"
3/31/25 1:26:09a Odesseus says, "oof"
3/31/25 1:26:09a Chitra says, "well... he DID hire th' Darshak.. so..."
3/31/25 1:26:09a Tigger says, "That would be bad."
3/31/25 1:26:09a Achates says, "tell he we don't have kings or nobility here... come meet us face to face as we exiles do to heck with your stooge"
3/31/25 1:26:09a Terenas says, "A necromancer shouldn't be able to use this magic..."
3/31/25 1:26:09a Chitra says, "mebbe he DO have limited resources"
3/31/25 1:26:10a Babajaga says, "He has."
3/31/25 1:26:10a Terenas says, "I'm just happy Tenebrion isn't consulting Zonk or Qual"
3/31/25 1:26:10a Babajaga says, "He needs more fresh bodies.."
3/31/25 1:26:11a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "I sell moonstone to Tenebrion for 80,000c. and run away with money and leave Tenebrion empty handed"
3/31/25 1:26:11a (Tigger thinks of d2Dark Shaman.)
3/31/25 1:26:11a Urgelt says, "necromancy is just a form of healing turned on its head."
3/31/25 1:26:11a Chitra exclaims, "shhh!"
3/31/25 1:26:11a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:26:11a (Babajaga scratches her neck)
3/31/25 1:26:11a Terenas says, "Mayabe we should:)"
3/31/25 1:26:12a Achates says, "He isn't fool"
3/31/25 1:26:12a Rcooka-e asks, "is he such a danger to us?.. he wants stuff from us.. we shouldn't give him.. why talking to him?"
3/31/25 1:26:12a Babajaga says, "Well. I think we need to ask that he comes in person"
3/31/25 1:26:12a (Chitra glances sharply at Baba)
3/31/25 1:26:12a Odesseus says, "look, if he could take something we have and he could,,, he would've"
3/31/25 1:26:13a Urgelt says, "what's important to know is what he really wants."
3/31/25 1:26:13a (Cyrril Co'Fei sell moonstone to tenebrion for 80,000c. and not tell anyone ;D)
3/31/25 1:26:13a (Odesseus just confused himself)
3/31/25 1:26:14a Urgelt says, "WHY he wants training."
3/31/25 1:26:14a Chitra asks, "yer neck botherin' you Baba? Sore throat?"
3/31/25 1:26:14a Urgelt says, "what his ultimate goals are."
3/31/25 1:26:14a Tigger says, "Good you saved me the trouble Odes."
3/31/25 1:26:15a Odesseus says, "heh"
3/31/25 1:26:16a Tessa asks, "Baba? You okay?"
3/31/25 1:26:16a Babajaga thinks, "Tenebrion, we may not be content with dealing only with your emissary. If you want to discuss matters, come to us your self."
3/31/25 1:26:16a Odesseus says, "I don't tink she ok"
3/31/25 1:26:17a Tigger says, "She looks a bit ashen."
3/31/25 1:26:17a Rcooka-e says, "as long he is not willing to tell us what he wants... we should ignore him... imho"
3/31/25 1:26:18a Odesseus asks, "she does?"
3/31/25 1:26:18a Arteress Lai says, "why do we not offer to send someone to him? If he harms that person in any way, he will affirm that he is a negative force, and will lose his opportunity to get what he wants."
3/31/25 1:26:19a Terenas says, "aye Rcooka, lets just ignore him:)"
3/31/25 1:26:19a Tenebrion thinks, "If the next time I send a man he is not accosted nor followed back, I may come myself."
3/31/25 1:26:19a You are now speaking the people language.
3/31/25 1:26:19a Chitra exclaims in People, "she also reacts violently if you mention her skin color.. so hush!"
3/31/25 1:26:19a Tigger ponders, "Looks like a pillar of stone rally"
3/31/25 1:26:19a Terenas says, "but i'm affraid this is a matter that cannot be ignored"
3/31/25 1:26:20a Haenk says, "ah"
3/31/25 1:26:20a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:26:20a Haenk says, "well"
3/31/25 1:26:20a Haenk says, "im bringing some news"
3/31/25 1:26:20a Terenas says, "well he is sending someone"
3/31/25 1:26:20a Cyrril Co'Fei says in People, "LOL, baba sensitive about her looks??? ROFL"
3/31/25 1:26:21a Urgelt says, "sounds like he will not do it now."
3/31/25 1:26:21a Rcooka-e asks, "he can't take what he wants.. so.. what is the danger?"
3/31/25 1:26:21a Haenk says, "i just talked to virgil"
3/31/25 1:26:21a (Babajaga sharpens her axe)
3/31/25 1:26:21a Urgelt says, "no telling who will be here when he does."
3/31/25 1:26:21a Odesseus asks in People, "what happened to her skin?"
3/31/25 1:26:21a Urgelt asks, "aye?"
3/31/25 1:26:21a Urgelt asks, "aye?"
3/31/25 1:26:22a Tigger asks, "And? He says it;s good to see you?"
3/31/25 1:26:22a WormTounge asks, "Rcooka, you want more darshak and undine attacking?"
3/31/25 1:26:22a Cyrril Co'Fei says in People, "It's grey, she looks DEAD =P"
3/31/25 1:26:23a Tigger asks, "You have much to learn?"
3/31/25 1:26:23a Haenk says, "he cant stop tenebrion from training with him"
3/31/25 1:26:23a Chitra says in People, "I don't know.. it occured after the .... episode with Qual.. and the Dew"
3/31/25 1:26:23a Rcooka-e says, "so far we've survied all"
3/31/25 1:26:23a Haenk says, "_if he is ready_"
3/31/25 1:26:24a WormTounge ponders, "So far."
3/31/25 1:26:24a Rcooka-e says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:26:24a Tigger asks, "How will we know when he's ready?"
3/31/25 1:26:24a Haenk says, "which means, he must have passed the tests"
3/31/25 1:26:24a Odesseus says in People, "ohhh, I thight she was just usin too much makeup"
3/31/25 1:26:25a Terenas says, "Well i'm affraid I have to go"
3/31/25 1:26:25a Urgelt says, "how very odd."
3/31/25 1:26:25a Tigger says, "bye Terenas"
3/31/25 1:26:25a Haenk says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:26:25a (Chitra glares at Ode)
3/31/25 1:26:25a Urgelt says, "I myself am a trainer, and I can choose not to train a person."
3/31/25 1:26:26a Cyrril Co'Fei says in People, "Aye, she doesn't like being grey... But she's been like that ever since qual Dewed her"
3/31/25 1:26:26a Terenas says, "Take care, and good luck"
3/31/25 1:26:26a (Odesseus shrugs helplessly)
3/31/25 1:26:26a Urgelt asks, "why is Virgil unable to do the same?"
3/31/25 1:26:26a Haenk says, "he _would_ be able to train him right now"
3/31/25 1:26:27a (Babajaga nods)
3/31/25 1:26:27a Haenk says, "but i convinced him not to do so"
3/31/25 1:26:27a Tigger says, "Perhaps he took oaths."
3/31/25 1:26:27a Terenas yells, "Hail and Farewell"
3/31/25 1:26:27a You are now speaking the common language.
3/31/25 1:26:27a Chitra says, "I no think Tenebrion weak"
3/31/25 1:26:28a Tessa says, "Maybe he has taken some oath to train all who ask and are ready."
3/31/25 1:26:28a Haenk says, "until we make a decision"
3/31/25 1:26:28a Haenk says, "but"
3/31/25 1:26:28a Cyrril Co'Fei yells, "Tally Ho for Babajaga the grey!!!! ;D"
3/31/25 1:26:28a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "Ah!"
3/31/25 1:26:29a Babajaga says, "Not at all. Do not underestimate him."
3/31/25 1:26:29a Haenk says, "there are other means to gain this knowledge"
3/31/25 1:26:29a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "WTF"
3/31/25 1:26:29a Chitra says, "prolly our "tests" be no challenge to him"
3/31/25 1:26:29a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "I said to say that in fen dammit!"
3/31/25 1:26:30a Tessa asks, "Oh?"
3/31/25 1:26:30a Cyrril Co'Fei exclaims, "and as a joke!"
3/31/25 1:26:30a Haenk says, "there are ancient tomes"
3/31/25 1:26:30a (Cyrril Co'Fei arghs)
3/31/25 1:26:30a Mac-arena says, "wooo"
3/31/25 1:26:30a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "wb Mac-a"
3/31/25 1:26:31a Tigger asks, "So...how long does it take Tenebrion to get 50 ranks?"
3/31/25 1:26:31a Haenk says, "offering the same knowldge"
3/31/25 1:26:31a Mac-arena exclaims, "I've got the whole rim of the island mapped!"
3/31/25 1:26:31a Haenk says, "but"
3/31/25 1:26:31a Haenk says, "good thing is"
3/31/25 1:26:32a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "God knows"
3/31/25 1:26:32a Babajaga says, "So, he is taking a short cut then.."
3/31/25 1:26:32a (Mac-arena the Bored Zo scribbles on his todo-list: GK bomb farhope)
3/31/25 1:26:32a Haenk says, "he has no idea about the whereabout"
3/31/25 1:26:33a Cyrril Co'Fei asks, "Why Mac-a?"
3/31/25 1:26:33a Babajaga says, "Good."
3/31/25 1:26:33a Mac-arena says, "she helped me with some of the brawnier critters :)"
3/31/25 1:26:33a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "ah"
3/31/25 1:26:34a Tigger ponders, "Damn it, she left the body above-ground..."
3/31/25 1:26:34a Haenk says, "nor does he know someone, he could know about them"
3/31/25 1:26:34a (Odesseus chuckles)
3/31/25 1:26:34a Mac-arena says, "also bore witness to my attempts to find caves (just in case I found one <G>)"
3/31/25 1:26:35a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "heh"
3/31/25 1:26:35a You slaughtered a Rat.
3/31/25 1:26:36a Haenk says, "i think this mainly gives us somewhat more time to make a decision"
3/31/25 1:26:36a Tigger ponders, "I told her: six feet, no less."
3/31/25 1:26:37a Urgelt says, "it's not time we need, it's information."
3/31/25 1:26:37a Haenk says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:26:37a Odesseus asks, "can we stash Virgilwhatisname somewhere safe? Under guard?"
3/31/25 1:26:38a Haenk says, "but virgil couldnt help with it"
3/31/25 1:26:38a Urgelt says, "we must be informed about what Tenebrion seeks to do."
3/31/25 1:26:38a Cyrril Co'Fei ponders, "heh"
3/31/25 1:26:38a Urgelt says, "that's very disturbing, Haenk."
3/31/25 1:26:39a Haenk says, "he didnt knew tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:26:39a Babajaga says, "I doubt he will tell us that.."
3/31/25 1:26:39a Tigger asks, "Why don't we ask Tenebrion himself?"
3/31/25 1:26:39a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Aye"
3/31/25 1:26:40a Rcooka-e asks, "stupid question maybe.. but did you asked him directly?"
3/31/25 1:26:40a Chitra says, "well.. 'less we ken git allies we no gonna find dat out Urgelt"
3/31/25 1:26:40a Haenk says, "yes"
3/31/25 1:26:40a Tigger says, "Bah, madmen ALWAYS tell you their evil plan."
3/31/25 1:26:40a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Mac-a : 4• healer trainer for purg pendant"
3/31/25 1:26:41a Odesseus exclaims, "true!"
3/31/25 1:26:42a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:26:42a (Mac-arena the Bored Zo leaps out of range!)
3/31/25 1:26:42a Chitra says, "attackin' his castle jest gonna irriate him more"
3/31/25 1:26:42a Odesseus ponders, "she hummin!"
3/31/25 1:26:43a Haenk says, "maybe we shouldnt tell tenebrion, that hes not ready to train"
3/31/25 1:26:43a Rcooka-e says, "as long as he don't say what he wants.. i would not meet him... nor an emmisary"
3/31/25 1:26:43a Tigger ponders, "That's about 2 inches."
3/31/25 1:26:43a Tessa whispers, "Where is his place?"
3/31/25 1:26:43a Haenk says, "we might get a smith"
3/31/25 1:26:44a Haenk says, "and he gets nothing =P"
3/31/25 1:26:44a Chitra whispers, "is on some other plane..."
3/31/25 1:26:45a Chitra whispers, "we gots dere through a "mirror""
3/31/25 1:26:45a Urgelt says, "can't deal falsely with people, Haenk."
3/31/25 1:26:45a Tigger asks, "Why is it we think we will get a smith???"
3/31/25 1:26:46a Tessa whispers, "Oh so the thing works now?"
3/31/25 1:26:46a Urgelt says, "what goes around, comes around."
3/31/25 1:26:46a Babajaga says, "What I saw of tenebrion in his castle, he seemed quite ready for some puny healer tests.."
3/31/25 1:26:46a Haenk says, "true"
3/31/25 1:26:46a Chitra whispers, "not dat one"
3/31/25 1:26:47a Chitra whispers, "a different one"
3/31/25 1:26:51a Tessa whispers, "Oh and now it's gone?"
3/31/25 1:26:52a Mac-arena says, "methinks tenebrion could beat the *@$%&#!! out of a greymyr"
3/31/25 1:26:52a Tigger asks, "He has a moonstone then?"
3/31/25 1:26:54a Rcooka-e ponders, "sunstoning is the savest for him.. why a meeting?"
3/31/25 1:26:54a Haenk asks, "so this means we need to protect the healer temple?"
3/31/25 1:26:55a Chitra whispers, "dis one inna fair grounds.. but.. .it not dere alla th' time"
3/31/25 1:26:56a Urgelt says, "I can't see a practical way to do that."
3/31/25 1:26:59a Tessa whispers, "In the fair grounds? you mean where people talk about the game?"
3/31/25 1:27:00a Tigger says, "Let's guard the bell, book, and candle then."
3/31/25 1:27:02a Tessa whispers, "So he is outside of the game somehow then?"
3/31/25 1:27:03a Haenk says, "that might be an idea too"
3/31/25 1:27:03a Chitra whispers, "I mean big grassy place inna middle of town"
3/31/25 1:27:05a Urgelt says, "there is nothing to stop Tenebrion from donning a cloak and sauntering through town."
3/31/25 1:27:05a Chitra whispers, "what you think I mean?"
3/31/25 1:27:05a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "close circle ;D"
3/31/25 1:27:07a Tessa whispers, "The fair ground?"
3/31/25 1:27:07a Mac-arena says, "hell, Watcher might be Tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Chitra whispers, "yaar"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Haenk says, "true"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Tessa whispers, "you know where the "instructions" are??"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Arteress Lai asks, "then why hasnt he yet?"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Mac-arena says, "they both seem to be 'with' the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Haenk says, "but if we think this way"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Arteress Lai says, "perhaps there is something to stop him that we do not know"
3/31/25 1:27:08a Mac-arena says, "lai, perhaps this was an attempt"
3/31/25 1:27:08a (Chitra looks confused)
3/31/25 1:27:09a Tessa whispers, "kinda where that nasty hut with that death guy is too?"
3/31/25 1:27:09a Haenk says, "we already have given in to him"
3/31/25 1:27:09a Urgelt says, "if we could get the gatekeepers to keep him out..."
3/31/25 1:27:09a (Odesseus has to get some shut eye)
3/31/25 1:27:12a Urgelt says, "that would be something good."
3/31/25 1:27:13a (Babajaga frowns)
3/31/25 1:27:15a Babajaga says, "Those.."
3/31/25 1:27:18a Tigger says, "Keep listening, you will."
3/31/25 1:27:20a Babajaga says, "They sleep at duty"
3/31/25 1:27:22a Chitra whispers, "dere helpful folks dere dat give advice to new exiles.. if dat what you mean...."
3/31/25 1:27:22a Mac-arena says, "urgelt, we'd need to sue tenebrion in absentia and find him guilty"
3/31/25 1:27:27a (Tessa nods)
3/31/25 1:27:28a Odesseus thinks to you, "lemme know if anything good comes of this"
3/31/25 1:27:28a Mac-arena says, "then sentence him to banishment"
3/31/25 1:27:29a (Tigger waves a paw.)
3/31/25 1:27:30a Tessa whispers, "yes but none of it makes any sense... it is other worldly."
3/31/25 1:27:32a You concentrate on sending your message to Odesseus.
3/31/25 1:27:33a Tessa whispers, "Clearly it's evidence that we're in a simulation of some sort."
3/31/25 1:27:35a Chitra whispers, "I dunno.. I never ask'em"
3/31/25 1:27:36a Babajaga asks, "Well. Someone make a Koppi report?"
3/31/25 1:27:37a Tigger says, "Perhaps we could bribe Glory."
3/31/25 1:27:37a Odesseus thinks to you, "an if you get a good enough clan together I jus might join it"
3/31/25 1:27:38a Tessa whispers, "You know... I think it's called 'Clan Lord' Too. I heard someone mention it."
3/31/25 1:27:45a Babajaga says, "short and to the point."
3/31/25 1:27:45a You concentrate on sending your message to Odesseus.
3/31/25 1:27:46a Tigger says, "Although I already tried that and it didn't work for me."
3/31/25 1:27:46a Tessa whispers, "I wonder if Tenebrion lives "out there.""
3/31/25 1:27:47a You just received good karma!
3/31/25 1:27:48a You gave good karma to Odesseus.
3/31/25 1:27:49a Chitra whispers, "um.. I dunno"
3/31/25 1:27:49a Babajaga says, "Like : Don´t kill tenebrions emissary when he comes to visit.. might.. work.."
3/31/25 1:27:49a Haenk says, "hmm"
3/31/25 1:27:49a Chitra ponders, "what th' HECK she talkin' 'bout?"
3/31/25 1:27:51a Babajaga says, "Or he will get fried as soon as he enters"
3/31/25 1:27:51a Haenk says, "probably wouldnt work"
3/31/25 1:27:51a Tessa ponders, "He looks confused and skeptical"
3/31/25 1:27:51a Tigger exclaims, "Or perhaps we could dress Urgelt up as Glory in a wig, and when Tenebrion goes to test...WHAM!"
3/31/25 1:27:51a Tessa ponders, "She looks confused and skeptical"
3/31/25 1:27:51a (Babajaga is practical)
3/31/25 1:27:52a Chitra says, "dat prolly sound best comin' frum you or Urgelt Baba >^-^<"
3/31/25 1:27:52a Tessa whispers, "No matter... I think I must have seen it in my dreams"
3/31/25 1:27:52a Urgelt says, "Baba, we have snerts."
3/31/25 1:27:53a Babajaga says, "Eeew.. those beasts.."
3/31/25 1:27:53a Rcooka-e says, "as long he is not hiding and showing who he is.. noone would touch him"
3/31/25 1:27:53a (Babajaga shudders)
3/31/25 1:27:53a Urgelt says, "if Koppi yells that, the snerts will just resolve to do it."
3/31/25 1:27:54a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:27:55a Bon Temps thinks, "up :)"
3/31/25 1:27:55a Babajaga says, "Yes.. and then we would be speaking to tenebrion himself..."
3/31/25 1:27:56a Tessa says, "Well then we could have Koppi yell "Don't take Tenebrion to the abyss!""
3/31/25 1:27:56a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "lol"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Mac-arena says, "make a show of trying `im"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Tigger asks, "Where's Tenebrion go anyway?"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Mac-arena says, "er"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "reverse psychology"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Mac-arena says, "of trying the snertts"
3/31/25 1:27:57a Mac-arena says, "of trying the snerts"
3/31/25 1:27:58a Tigger says, "I mean...he stopped talking."
3/31/25 1:27:58a Babajaga asks, "We want to talk to tenebrion don´t we? And not his emissary?"
3/31/25 1:27:59a Urgelt says, "I'd happily talk to his emissary."
3/31/25 1:27:59a Babajaga says, "let the snert beasties deal with the emissary then.."
3/31/25 1:27:59a Mac-arena says, "baba, I highly doubt tenebrion'll come out from behind his emissary"
3/31/25 1:27:59a You concentrate on sending your message to Urgelt.
3/31/25 1:27:59a Rcooka-e says, "first i want to know what he wants exactly"
3/31/25 1:27:59a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "I wanna talk to him in person"
3/31/25 1:27:59a Tessa asks, "Baba honestly I wouldn't know the difference... would you?"
3/31/25 1:27:59a Urgelt thinks to you, "*nod*"
3/31/25 1:28:00a Mac-arena says, "I'm really surprised qual doesn't send an emissary of some kind"
3/31/25 1:28:01a Mac-arena says, "instead of showing up himself"
3/31/25 1:28:01a Chitra says, "Tenebrion supposedly distinctive lookin'"
3/31/25 1:28:01a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "aye"
3/31/25 1:28:01a Babajaga asks, "Difference from the snert beasties and the emissary?"
3/31/25 1:28:01a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "Chitra - Tenebrion looks like a shadow"
3/31/25 1:28:02a Babajaga says, "Tenebrion is.. a sylvan.."
3/31/25 1:28:02a Chitra says, "he look sorta like a Sylvan.. but.. he all dark.. dark skin.. .dark hair..."
3/31/25 1:28:02a Babajaga says, "Dark."
3/31/25 1:28:02a Tigger ponders, "That figures."
3/31/25 1:28:02a Tessa says, "No.. difference between an emissary and the man."
3/31/25 1:28:03a Tessa asks, "How do you know that?"
3/31/25 1:28:03a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "and has jet black hair/skin/clothes"
3/31/25 1:28:03a Chitra says, "er.. silver hair. sorry"
3/31/25 1:28:03a Babajaga says, "I have met him."
3/31/25 1:28:03a Tessa asks, "Dark.... like you?"
3/31/25 1:28:03a Chitra says, "my Friend seen him"
3/31/25 1:28:03a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "No. his hair is black"
3/31/25 1:28:04a Chitra says, "no.. I light >^-^<"
3/31/25 1:28:04a Babajaga says, "he looks like Death Lord"
3/31/25 1:28:04a Chitra says, "compared to him >^-^<"
3/31/25 1:28:04a Babajaga says, "Only .. sylvan figure."
3/31/25 1:28:05a Tigger says, "Maybe he IS Death Lord"
3/31/25 1:28:05a Tessa asks, "Well has anyone ELSE met him too?"
3/31/25 1:28:05a Chitra says, "he a Dark Elf"
3/31/25 1:28:05a Tessa asks, "Who has met him?"
3/31/25 1:28:05a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "He's got all black clothes and hair, like Rcooka"
3/31/25 1:28:05a Babajaga says, "Of course Tessa"
3/31/25 1:28:06a (Babajaga hums softly.)
3/31/25 1:28:06a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "and black skin"
3/31/25 1:28:06a (Babajaga eyes Chitra)
3/31/25 1:28:06a Cyrril Co'Fei says, "and a black belt"
3/31/25 1:28:06a Chitra says, "Slyph met him I think"
3/31/25 1:28:06a Tessa asks, "Who exactly... then?"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Mac-arena asks, "tig, Tenebrion and the Darshak are allies. which leaves the question of why would Qual dew DeathLord, if DeathLord is Tenebrion?"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Babajaga says, "Terenas has met him"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Babajaga says, "org duLac"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Mac-arena asks, "...is Tenebrion?"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Babajaga says, "Gurgi"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Chitra says, "I pretty sure Astrid meet him too"
3/31/25 1:28:07a Tessa says, "Oh he was here earlier... drat."
3/31/25 1:28:08a Haenk ponders, "brb"
3/31/25 1:28:08a Tigger asks, "huh?"
3/31/25 1:28:08a Cyrril Co'Fei ponders, "<ooc> Gotta restart, BBIAM"
3/31/25 1:28:08a Rcooka-e says, "however... i don't realy trust your intentions in that Baba.. sorry"
3/31/25 1:28:08a Chitra says, "she th' one who describe him to me"
3/31/25 1:28:09a (Babajaga blinks)
3/31/25 1:28:09a Babajaga asks, "How so?"
3/31/25 1:28:09a You are sharing experiences with Urgelt (*), Thuja, J'nder and Tigger.
3/31/25 1:28:09a Currently sharing their experiences with you: Haenk, Tigger, Urgelt.
3/31/25 1:28:09a Mac-arena says, "if DeathLord is Tenebrion, and Tenebrion is allied with the Darshak, then there's no reason for Qual to dew DeathLord"
3/31/25 1:28:09a (Chitra shrugs)
3/31/25 1:28:09a Rcooka-e says, "dunno.. a feeling"
3/31/25 1:28:09a Tessa says, "I see.... so they would be the only ones who would know."
3/31/25 1:28:10a Mac-arena says, "if DeathLord is Tenebrion, and Tenebrion is allied with the Darshak, thenno reason for Qual to dew DeathLord"
3/31/25 1:28:10a Mac-arena says, "if DeathLord is Tenebrion, and Tenebrion is allied with the Darshak, then no reason for Qual to dew DeathLord"
3/31/25 1:28:10a Urgelt says, "DL is not Tenebrion."
3/31/25 1:28:10a Urgelt says, "dead end."
3/31/25 1:28:11a Mac-arena says, "right, that's my point, urgelt"
3/31/25 1:28:11a Babajaga says, "You all yourself have stated that you want to talk to Tenebrion and not his emissary"
3/31/25 1:28:11a Tigger says, "Well...perhaps that's just what he wants you to think."
3/31/25 1:28:11a Chitra says, "she say she try to help fallen at his keep"
3/31/25 1:28:11a Mac-arena says, "tig - uh-huh ;P"
3/31/25 1:28:12a Tessa says, "I didn't. I really don't think it matters.. Progress is progress."
3/31/25 1:28:12a Tigger says, "Well Urgelt said he would talk to the emissary."
3/31/25 1:28:12a Mac-arena says, "if Ten's a Sylvan, he DOESN'T want to be dewed."
3/31/25 1:28:14a Babajaga says, "Hmm"
3/31/25 1:28:14a Urgelt says, "of course, one of the things we'd want of the emissary is a meeting with Tenebrion himself."
3/31/25 1:28:14a (Babajaga nods)
3/31/25 1:28:15a Rcooka-e ponders, "need to talk to Sleipnir soon"
3/31/25 1:28:15a Urgelt says, "I can't see it would hurt to talk to an emissary."
3/31/25 1:28:16a (Chitra sighs)
3/31/25 1:28:16a Mac-arena says, "heh slit the emissary's throat and pin a note to his back saying "WE WANT TENEBRION" and leave the corpse on Noth ;D"
3/31/25 1:28:16a Tigger asks, "So how does one contact this emissary?"
3/31/25 1:28:16a Chitra says, "no.. prolly not"
3/31/25 1:28:16a Babajaga says, "I just feel we are giving in to him..."
3/31/25 1:28:16a Mac-arena says, "tig, probably the other way round."
3/31/25 1:28:17a Urgelt says, "Tenebrion does not live on noth."
3/31/25 1:28:17a Mac-arena says, "urgelt, whatever"
3/31/25 1:28:17a Urgelt says, "absurd suggestion, anyway."
3/31/25 1:28:18a Mac-arena says, "actually he probably lives on Ash"
3/31/25 1:28:18a Mac-arena says, "given his alliance with the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:28:18a Urgelt says, "no."
3/31/25 1:28:18a Urgelt says, "not there either."
3/31/25 1:28:18a Mac-arena says, "where on Ash, is the question"
3/31/25 1:28:19a Babajaga says, "I think he lives further from town than that."
3/31/25 1:28:19a Urgelt says, "he has his own lands."
3/31/25 1:28:19a Mac-arena says, "that's likely too"
3/31/25 1:28:19a Tigger ponders, "I think he lives in a mirror"
3/31/25 1:28:20a Babajaga says, "If I would guess, I would guess around.. Peacton"
3/31/25 1:28:20a Urgelt says, "Here's another question that hasn't been answered, Baba."
3/31/25 1:28:20a Chitra says, "prolly lot further... only access we find is thru mirror"
3/31/25 1:28:21a Mac-arena says, "baba, there's a castle in Nordisland..."
3/31/25 1:28:21a Urgelt says, "something that has been bothering me."
3/31/25 1:28:21a Mac-arena says, "perhaps it's there."
3/31/25 1:28:22a Urgelt says, "Tenebrion clearly does not want trespassers."
3/31/25 1:28:22a Chitra ponders, "which remind me... WHO set up mirror to Tenebrion's land?"
3/31/25 1:28:22a Urgelt says, "Tenebrion clearly did not want you to see his notes."
3/31/25 1:28:23a Haenk ponders, "brb"
3/31/25 1:28:23a Tigger asks, "If that's so, then why did he invite us in?"
3/31/25 1:28:23a Urgelt says, "Tenebrion has resisted all incursions."
3/31/25 1:28:23a Chitra says, "mebbe we gots secret ally"
3/31/25 1:28:25a Urgelt says, "so it seems unlikely that Tenebrion put the mirror in the fairgrounds."
3/31/25 1:28:25a Mac-arena says, "but with Qual having taken Votenkath's Castle, and the barrier that's been there for some years now, I don't think we can get to nordisland"

3/31/25 1:28:30a Babajaga says, "he has been seen in the cave"
3/31/25 1:28:30a Mac-arena says, "and the guard was with chum when it was all over..."

3/31/25 1:28:31a Urgelt says, "Vampire does not like Darshak magic."
3/31/25 1:28:32a Urgelt says, "Tenebrion may find himself with an enemy."
3/31/25 1:28:32a Chitra says, "dat why Lilit Like Elenis.. cause HE gots Mark of th' Vampire"
3/31/25 1:28:32a Mac-arena asks, "whose mark?"
3/31/25 1:28:33a Mac-arena asks, "oh, the vampire?"
3/31/25 1:28:33a Babajaga says, "I don´t know is she accpeted"
3/31/25 1:28:34a Mac-arena says, "might be somethin'a ask her"
3/31/25 1:28:34a Rcooka-e ponders, "we're just playballs between different forces"
3/31/25 1:28:34a Babajaga says, "I think he may have one already."
3/31/25 1:28:34a Tessa ponders, "Who is Lilit?"
3/31/25 1:28:35a Tigger ponders, "at least two"
3/31/25 1:28:35a Babajaga says, "But.. I´m presuming.. I don´t know.."
3/31/25 1:28:35a Mac-arena says, "Lilit is the high priestess of the nox sorora."
3/31/25 1:28:35a Bon Temps thinks, "several hoodeds drifting around east field, south side."
3/31/25 1:28:35a Urgelt says, "Lilit is a witch."
3/31/25 1:28:36a Mac-arena says, "the same outfit indigo's involved in"
3/31/25 1:28:36a Babajaga says, "Lilit is in search of Knowledge"
3/31/25 1:28:37a Tessa exclaims, "Wow thank you! You read my mind!"
3/31/25 1:28:37a (Chitra narrows her eyes)
3/31/25 1:28:37a Tessa says, "I was just about to ask that."
3/31/25 1:28:37a Mac-arena says, "lilit is also enemy (and quarry) of m'harr, sent by the Darshak to capture her, and here himself to get the grimoire"
3/31/25 1:28:37a Urgelt ponders, "Lilit is more than a little nuts."
3/31/25 1:28:38a Chitra says, "Lilit evil"
3/31/25 1:28:38a Tigger says, "Indigo is much nicer."
3/31/25 1:28:38a (Tessa nods)
3/31/25 1:28:39a Tessa says, "Yet a friend of our ally."
3/31/25 1:28:39a Babajaga says, "No. Not evil. Misguided perhaps."
3/31/25 1:28:39a Mac-arena says, "and lilit is the one largely responsible for summoning undine to the undine hut"
3/31/25 1:28:39a Tigger says, "Well...cept for trying to murder her husband and all..."
3/31/25 1:28:39a Tessa says, "Interesting."
3/31/25 1:28:39a Chitra says, "Indigo jest more subtle Tigger"
3/31/25 1:28:39a Mac-arena says, "and lilit is the one largely responsible for summoning (more) undine to the undine hut"
3/31/25 1:28:40a Chitra says, "I no agree Baba"
3/31/25 1:28:40a Mac-arena asks, "tig, who?"
3/31/25 1:28:40a Babajaga says, "Vampire trusts her."
3/31/25 1:28:40a Tigger says, "Indigo Mac"
3/31/25 1:28:41a Mac-arena says, "I know"
3/31/25 1:28:41a Chitra asks, "so?"
3/31/25 1:28:41a Mac-arena asks, "who's her husband?"
3/31/25 1:28:41a Urgelt says, "a mistake he may rue one day."
3/31/25 1:28:42a Urgelt says, "her goals are not his."
3/31/25 1:28:43a Babajaga says, "Interestingly enough.... she was asked to bear the mar to be an emissary for the vampire to .. Qual."
3/31/25 1:28:43a Chitra says, "Undine shock troops durin' th' Ripture war...."
3/31/25 1:28:43a Mac-arena says, "from everything I can tell, lilit is not a BAD thing, if not especially good"
3/31/25 1:28:43a Babajaga says, "Interestingly enough.... she was asked to bear the mark to be an emissary for the vampire to .. Qual."
3/31/25 1:28:44a Chitra says, "nobody who ... dere "friend" is good in my book"
3/31/25 1:28:46a Rcooka-e says, "sounds more like a spy than an emissary"
3/31/25 1:28:46a Chitra says, "dis devisive .."
3/31/25 1:28:47a Tessa says, "Well I've not met her. Naamah I have met. Not Lilit. And anyway I don't think that i so important."
3/31/25 1:28:47a Babajaga says, "Still, a visit to Lilit and the undine cave might not be a bad idea.. before we meet tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:28:47a Mac-arena says, "I do know that Fire Island - broken up into four pieces by whatever formed that crater and planted the voolcons - is important to the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:28:47a Chitra says, "is best we present unified front to Tenebrion"
3/31/25 1:28:48a Mac-arena says, "...is important to the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:28:49a Mac-arena says, "and anything important to the Darshak is important to me"
3/31/25 1:28:49a Urgelt says, "Vampire's opinion should be solicited."
3/31/25 1:28:49a (Babajaga nods)
3/31/25 1:28:50a Chitra says, "yaar.. an' Falinea's"
3/31/25 1:28:50a Babajaga asks, "Ask elenis to speak with him?"
3/31/25 1:28:50a J'nder thinks, "anyone with Salvador?"
3/31/25 1:28:50a Mac-arena says, "I should probably hunt down selucreh - I heard he knows a way into that crater"
3/31/25 1:28:50a Babajaga says, "Only one with the mark left"
3/31/25 1:28:51a Mac-arena ponders, "in fact, I think I found it too"
3/31/25 1:28:52a Chitra says, "her people work with Moonstones.. and with th' powers of th' isle.. long before WE gits here"
3/31/25 1:28:52a Mac-arena ponders, "s'a bitch getting in tho..."
3/31/25 1:28:52a Chitra says, "also.. we should ask Hekus.."
3/31/25 1:28:52a Tessa says, "Yeah I heard about her."
3/31/25 1:28:53a Chitra says, "but.. I no think he gonna talk to us"
3/31/25 1:28:53a Mac-arena says, "chitra, that's one point... the 'moonstones'"
3/31/25 1:28:53a Mac-arena says, "they aren't true moonstones, I remember those"
3/31/25 1:28:54a (Chitra shrugs)
3/31/25 1:28:55a Mac-arena says, "these are what used to be called moogstones... they're not entirely dissimilar to the soulglasses planted among us by the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:28:55a Tessa says, "Well it still works better than sutures and tape."
3/31/25 1:28:55a Mac-arena says, "...among us by the Darshak"
3/31/25 1:28:55a Chitra asks, "moonstones is moonstones.. I a fighter, what I know?"
3/31/25 1:28:56a Mac-arena says, "tessa, aye :D"
3/31/25 1:28:56a Mac-arena says, "chitra, I'm a fighter, and I know a lot ;P"
3/31/25 1:28:57a Urgelt says, "so you say."
3/31/25 1:28:57a (Mac-arena the Bored Zo, Darshak Conspiracy Theorist Extraordinaire)
3/31/25 1:28:57a (Chitra chuckles)
3/31/25 1:28:57a Mac-arena says, "(etc.)"
3/31/25 1:28:58a Mac-arena asks, "urgelt - and what cause have you to doubt me?"
3/31/25 1:28:58a Urgelt says, "if words are knowledge, you have made us all geniuses."
3/31/25 1:28:59a Mac-arena says, "hehehe"
3/31/25 1:28:59a Mac-arena says, "I hope so"
3/31/25 1:29:00a Mac-arena says, "the greater number of geniuses, the greater number of sages"
3/31/25 1:29:01a Tessa exclaims, "Well now... I think I need to rest on it... I've been up all night and it's nearly dawn!"
3/31/25 1:29:01a (Tessa points to the east)
3/31/25 1:29:01a Chitra says, "opinions like butts...."
3/31/25 1:29:01a Tigger says, "And if words are rocks, you have all made my head hurt a lot."
3/31/25 1:29:01a Mac-arena says, "lol tig"
3/31/25 1:29:02a Chitra says, "everybody gots one..."
3/31/25 1:29:02a Babajaga says, "Well, if you want to read the full report from tenebrions keep, it´s in the library"
3/31/25 1:29:02a J'nder thinks, "Salvador up"
3/31/25 1:29:02a Mac-arena says, "say that again tig :)"
3/31/25 1:29:02a Babajaga says, "Err diary.."
3/31/25 1:29:02a (Urgelt nods.)
3/31/25 1:29:02a (Tessa nods)
3/31/25 1:29:03a Salvador thinks, "thanks to you j'nder and baffette"
3/31/25 1:29:03a Tigger says, "Not that I don't appreciate your trying to unravel this mystery, mind you..."
3/31/25 1:29:03a Tessa says, "Thanks there Baba.... I think Koppi pointed me there."
3/31/25 1:29:04a (Tessa smiles)
3/31/25 1:29:04a Tessa says, "I'll check it out."
3/31/25 1:29:05a Salvador thinks, "two very fine healers in these lands"
3/31/25 1:29:05a Tessa says, "Good day to you all then, and thanks Dwarf for organizing everything."
3/31/25 1:29:05a Mac-arena says, "I personally think Fire Island bears more investigation..."
3/31/25 1:29:05a Tigger says, "I will just hopefull ready Baba's diary and have it all explained."
3/31/25 1:29:05a Mac-arena says, "...and less fear."
3/31/25 1:29:06a Babajaga says, "Farewell all."
3/31/25 1:29:06a Tigger says, "Bye Tessa"
3/31/25 1:29:06a Tigger says, "Bye Baba"
3/31/25 1:29:06a Mac-arena says, "bye doc :)"

3/31/25 1:29:08a Urgelt ponders, "bleh, I have a name."
3/31/25 1:29:08a Chitra says, "well..."
3/31/25 1:29:08a Mac-arena says, "nothing I've seen on FI really deserves the loathing it gets"
3/31/25 1:29:08a Tigger says, "I must sleep as well, good night people. I hope you are all still alive when I return."
3/31/25 1:29:09a (Mac-arena the Bored Zo waves to tig)
3/31/25 1:29:09a Chitra says, "I think nuthin' else gonna happen tonight"
3/31/25 1:29:09a Chitra says, "but.."

3/31/25 1:29:13a Urgelt asks, "Haenk, you are 4th now?"

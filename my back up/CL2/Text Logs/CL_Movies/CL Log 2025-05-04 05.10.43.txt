5/4/25 5:10:47a (Brooke Britney shakes her head, flouncing her perfectly coiffed ringlets.)
5/4/25 5:10:47a Phroon says, "Ahh."
5/4/25 5:10:47a Seaforth says, "if Kani doesnt show, I'm not giving his robe back"
5/4/25 5:10:50a Garr asks, "Hi Brooke! How's the building plans coming along?"
5/4/25 5:10:50a Dandelion says, "Scootch in, Crunch"
5/4/25 5:10:50a (Phroon recaps.)
5/4/25 5:10:51a (Brooke Britney claps her hands briskly.)
5/4/25 5:10:51a (Shadowfire waves cheerily.)
5/4/25 5:10:52a (Dandelion waves)
5/4/25 5:10:52a Phroon says, "So… a few Lore Tours back we were sent on a hunt for some things that ended up being for the fountain"
5/4/25 5:10:52a Inu Teisei says, "pull crunch"
5/4/25 5:10:52a Crius yells, "It’s 1 o’clock, and all’s well."
5/4/25 5:10:52a Warawonda says, "come closer brooke is here"
5/4/25 5:10:52a Law'n St'ple ponders, "ZZZzzzz..."
5/4/25 5:10:53a Ravenstorm says, "hi"
5/4/25 5:10:53a Crius yells, "It looks pretty quiet on the Portal Island."
5/4/25 5:10:53a (Crunch grins)
5/4/25 5:10:53a Inu Teisei says, "all i sees are names"
5/4/25 5:10:53a Katreesa says, "hi"
5/4/25 5:10:55a Inu Teisei ponders, "does brooke have cooties?"
5/4/25 5:10:55a Brooke Britney says, "Many things in motion, many things."
5/4/25 5:10:55a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:10:55a Seaforth asks, "Does Brooke have answers for why there is an inch of water in the floor of the Temple?"
5/4/25 5:10:56a Kevas ponders, "One hestiates to speculate"
5/4/25 5:10:56a Katreesa drinks a red herring potion.
5/4/25 5:10:56a Dandelion exclaims, "Dat's a good question!"
5/4/25 5:10:57a Phroon says, "There was some talk at the end about the fountain and what was next for Puddleby."
5/4/25 5:10:57a (Katreesa giggles)
5/4/25 5:10:58a (Brooke Britney politely ignores Phroon's question, for the moment.)
5/4/25 5:10:58a Garr ponders, "Katfist"
5/4/25 5:10:58a Brooke Britney says, "The water, yes, a minor trouble."
5/4/25 5:10:59a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
5/4/25 5:11:22a Brooke Britney says, "Lithia Akka's dwarves have been digging and delving."
5/4/25 5:11:22a Shadowmutt growls, "Grrr."
5/4/25 5:11:22a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:11:23a Brooke Britney says, "Canals, you know, for that fountain."
5/4/25 5:11:23a Brooke Britney ponders, "This has been much more trouble than I anticipated."
5/4/25 5:11:23a Inu Teisei ponders, "altar is part of the plan for fountain, <check>"
5/4/25 5:11:23a Warawonda ponders, "wait..."
5/4/25 5:11:24a Warawonda asks, "hmm?"
5/4/25 5:11:24a Brooke Britney says, "It may have destabilized the foundation. A little bit."
5/4/25 5:11:24a Dandelion is sharing experiences with you.
5/4/25 5:11:25a Inu Teisei says, "ruh roh"
5/4/25 5:11:25a Law'n St'ple ponders, "ZZZzzzz..."
5/4/25 5:11:25a Phroon says, "Ah, very puddly"
5/4/25 5:11:25a Koppi yells, "Talin reports: please stop bringing big monsters to where younger players travel. you ruin the fun not just for the few you might want to mess with, but many more."
5/4/25 5:11:25a Garr asks, "Is our town sinking?"
5/4/25 5:11:26a Brooke Britney exclaims, "I'm sure there won't be any lasting consequences, though!"
5/4/25 5:11:26a (Brooke Britney smiles brightly.)
5/4/25 5:11:26a Inu Teisei ponders, "do I sense a plot twist that we lose this altar"
5/4/25 5:11:26a Warawonda asks, "?"
5/4/25 5:11:27a Brooke Britney says, "Perhaps a new roof. It seems to have shed a few of its pebbles."
5/4/25 5:11:29a Brooke Britney says, "Yes. We'll have to divert a few of the funds to re-roof."
5/4/25 5:11:29a Seaforth ponders, "Dwarves seem consistently BAD at digging."
5/4/25 5:11:30a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:11:31a Inu Teisei ponders, "ca-ching"
5/4/25 5:11:31a Brooke Britney says, "It's fine. Donations have been generous. We probably won't need a new levy."
5/4/25 5:11:31a Seaforth says, "I don't think the water is coming from the roof."
5/4/25 5:11:31a Garr says, "You should hire more zo like Unk"
5/4/25 5:11:32a Garr says, "He did a great job digging on Tenebrion's Island"
5/4/25 5:11:32a Phroon asks, "Can one dig a new roof?"
5/4/25 5:11:33a Dandelion exclaims, "He sure did, Garr!"
5/4/25 5:11:33a Kevas says, "Depends how far one digs."
5/4/25 5:11:34a Shobaffum says, "i dig new roofs they are awesome"
5/4/25 5:11:34a Brooke Britney asks, "And what do you think, Titus Kojiro DeLouche St. Thoomignon, Lord Seaforth, Imperial Navy Commander in absentia, the Bolt-Scarred, Organicus, etc etc?"
5/4/25 5:11:35a (Phroon nods to Shobaffum)
5/4/25 5:11:35a Garr says, "Oh, Thooms are the best roofers I think, because they love all that nice sunshine"
5/4/25 5:11:37a Warawonda asks, "whats this new roof going look like?"
5/4/25 5:11:37a Brooke Britney says, "Waterproof. We can hope."
5/4/25 5:11:38a Brooke Britney yells, "If it's not too much trouble."
5/4/25 5:11:38a Seaforth says, "Brooke Britney, I think your incompetent Dwarves have introduced water from BENEATH the Temple"
5/4/25 5:11:38a Warawonda ponders, "hope?"
5/4/25 5:11:38a Garr asks, "Can we equip it with ballistas to shoot rats?"
5/4/25 5:11:39a (Brooke Britney looks briefly irritated.)
5/4/25 5:11:39a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:11:39a Kevas asks, "So, I may not be a structural engineer, but shouldn't we be more worried about the foundation than the roof?"
5/4/25 5:11:40a Brooke Britney asks, "Now there's an idea. A tower in town center?"
5/4/25 5:11:40a Shobaffum says, "Garr that is the best idea ever"
5/4/25 5:11:40a Inu Teisei ponders, "dancing for irritation's sake, check"
5/4/25 5:11:41a Brooke Britney asks, "Are there any wizards among you to staff the tower?"
5/4/25 5:11:42a Seaforth says, "Well done on remembering my full title, though. Bravo."
5/4/25 5:11:43a (Phroon looks around.)
5/4/25 5:11:43a Brooke Britney asks, "Or artillerists?"
5/4/25 5:11:43a Crunch asks, "Anyone seen Malkor?"
5/4/25 5:11:44a (Brooke Britney glances at Kevas.)
5/4/25 5:11:45a Dandelion says, "Is Malky a Wizard? I tought 'e was an imp"
5/4/25 5:11:45a Phroon says, "I mean… we have a catapult. Not that it's all that useful either."
5/4/25 5:11:45a Brooke Britney says, "Yes, perhaps we should be concerned about the foundation. Treating the cause as well as the symptoms, eh? You should be a chirurgeon."
5/4/25 5:11:45a Crunch asks, "Or Geraldus?"
5/4/25 5:11:45a Garr says, "Didn't we liberate a lightning tower or something from Tenebrions? Or was that for our rainbow cannon? I can't remember anymore"
5/4/25 5:11:45a Brooke Britney says, "You should be a chirurgeon."
5/4/25 5:11:46a Kevas says, "Healing is my metier, yes."
5/4/25 5:11:47a Cecil says, "we can fling a mystic up there with a catapult"
5/4/25 5:11:48a (Brooke Britney curtseys.)
5/4/25 5:11:48a Inu Teisei is sharing experiences with you.
5/4/25 5:11:48a Brooke Britney says, "You meet your metier with mettle."
5/4/25 5:11:49a (Warawonda hides)
5/4/25 5:11:49a (Brooke Britney sketches down ideas.)
5/4/25 5:11:49a Inu Teisei asks, "Can we get a rainbow covering on the roof?"
5/4/25 5:11:50a Brooke Britney ponders, "New tower… catapult in east town… fling mystic to new tower."
5/4/25 5:11:50a Squib ponders, "Where's my rainbow??"
5/4/25 5:11:50a Seaforth says, "Garr, in order to comprehend rainbow lightning towers, it is necessary to take more drugs. Trust me."
5/4/25 5:11:50a (Squib looks around sadly)
5/4/25 5:11:50a (Brooke Britney smiles briskly.)
5/4/25 5:11:51a Brooke Britney says, "Very good."
5/4/25 5:11:52a Koppi yells, "Coriakin reports: Next bard concert will be at Lugubrion's Keep! May 31st at 11am pacific time"
5/4/25 5:11:52a Inu Teisei ponders, "no you don't it's called IMAGINATION!"
5/4/25 5:11:52a Brooke Britney yells, "Lithia! Send some of your dwarves to shore up the temple foundation."
5/4/25 5:11:54a Ravenstorm says, "hopefully they are up to the task"
5/4/25 5:11:54a Brooke Britney asks, "Has anyone seen LittlePrince?"
5/4/25 5:11:54a Seaforth says, "I'm just going with what Capt. Stinkfist told me"
5/4/25 5:11:55a Garr says, "As long as there aren't any holes that drop non-mystics into that underground lake I'll be happy"
5/4/25 5:11:55a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:11:55a Warawonda ponders, "!"
5/4/25 5:11:55a Dandelion says, "I tink he is busy wit his wife"
5/4/25 5:11:57a (Brooke Britney looks disappointed.)
5/4/25 5:11:57a Cecil asks, "we can fill the holes with mystcis?"
5/4/25 5:11:57a Ravenstorm says, "LittlePrince has been around but he currently is not on Brooke..sorry"
5/4/25 5:11:57a Brooke Britney says, "So, fountains."
5/4/25 5:11:58a (Warawonda nods)
5/4/25 5:11:58a Dandelion asks, "Plural?"
5/4/25 5:11:58a Seaforth says, "So,"
5/4/25 5:11:58a Yigdal says, "I'm collecting crystals for Lithia Akka's fountain."
5/4/25 5:11:58a Yigdal ponders, "She has such grandiose plans."
5/4/25 5:11:58a Yigdal says, "I still need some selenite crystals."
5/4/25 5:11:59a Yigdal says, "I'm collecting crystals for Lithia Akka's fountain."
5/4/25 5:11:59a Yigdal ponders, "She has such grandiose plans."
5/4/25 5:12:00a (Brooke Britney flicks dust off her bodice.)
5/4/25 5:12:00a Seaforth says, "Fountains of WATER, to be clear. Not... blood, or rats, or anything like that."
5/4/25 5:12:01a Dandelion exclaims, "Bravo, Seafort!"
5/4/25 5:12:02a Brooke Britney says, "Yes. The purest, most sparkling water."
5/4/25 5:12:02a (Seaforth checks the contract)
5/4/25 5:12:02a Garr says, "I doubt you'd hear bloodmages complain about a blood fountain"
5/4/25 5:12:03a Inu Teisei ponders, "correction: Yes Dear."
5/4/25 5:12:04a Phroon asks, "And the selenite?"
5/4/25 5:12:04a (Brooke Britney compares the plans for the fountain of blood and the fountain of water, but puts one back in her bejeweled handbag.)
5/4/25 5:12:05a Inu Teisei asks, "do we get the blood?"
5/4/25 5:12:06a (Brooke Britney smiles sweetly.)
5/4/25 5:12:06a Dandelion whispers, "Selenite?"
5/4/25 5:12:06a (Garr looks up at the bejeweled handbag)
5/4/25 5:12:06a Garr ponders, "Shiny!"
5/4/25 5:12:06a (Inu Teisei rubs her grubby paws together)
5/4/25 5:12:06a Brooke Britney says, "We could still go for the blood."
5/4/25 5:12:07a Seaforth says, "NO"
5/4/25 5:12:07a Inu Teisei says, "c ome one"
5/4/25 5:12:07a Dandelion says, "Let's not"
5/4/25 5:12:07a Seaforth says, "Just water."
5/4/25 5:12:08a Inu Teisei says, "c ome on"
5/4/25 5:12:08a Warawonda ponders, "a healing fountain?"
5/4/25 5:12:08a Inu Teisei says, "imagine"
5/4/25 5:12:08a Brooke Britney ponders, "The imperious voice of command. Hard to resist."
5/4/25 5:12:08a Inu Teisei says, "BMs"
5/4/25 5:12:08a Inu Teisei says, "insta charged"
5/4/25 5:12:09a Brooke Britney says, "The stonemasons have been hard at work. The final shape is coming together."
5/4/25 5:12:09a Brooke Britney says, "There's just one little problem."
5/4/25 5:12:10a Inu Teisei says, "or just make it an alternate donation site for the blood pool"
5/4/25 5:12:10a Seaforth says, "No gouts, no geysers. Fountain."
5/4/25 5:12:10a (Phroon nods)
5/4/25 5:12:10a Warawonda asks, "?"
5/4/25 5:12:11a Seaforth says, "A moderate spray."
5/4/25 5:12:11a Kevas ponders, "only one? That's promising."
5/4/25 5:12:11a Dandelion whispers, "Ah! Tanks. Missed dat"
5/4/25 5:12:11a Warawonda asks, "whats the problem?"
5/4/25 5:12:11a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:12:11a Brooke Britney says, "Lithia wanted to make it, well, fancy."
5/4/25 5:12:12a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:12:12a Brooke Britney says, "Yigdal's been collecting some supplies, but even I have a few doubts."
5/4/25 5:12:12a Brooke Britney exclaims, "Nothing that cannot be overcome!"
5/4/25 5:12:13a Cecil says, "if only Stone-that-Walk was still around"
5/4/25 5:12:13a Garr says, "She should talk to MrFancypants about that then"
5/4/25 5:12:13a Brooke Britney says, "With the power of money (and a good authority figure like Lord Seaforth here), I'm sure we can accomplish anything."
5/4/25 5:12:15a Phroon says, "Money is Power, Power is Money. I mean, just look at Kalian."
5/4/25 5:12:15a Brooke Britney says, "Do any of you have experience talking to Hekus? He hasn't been answering my sunstone messages."
5/4/25 5:12:16a (Brooke Britney pouts.)
5/4/25 5:12:17a Warawonda asks, "should we go talk to him?"
5/4/25 5:12:17a Dandelion asks, "Yes, Hekus is a friend. Why?"
5/4/25 5:12:17a Seaforth exclaims, "Fanciness should be inherent in the quality of the work! Not from attaching baubles!"
5/4/25 5:12:18a Koppi yells, "Slyph reports: Love on! Act now, and my 16 visionstone series is yours for the low price of 20k."
5/4/25 5:12:18a Brooke Britney says, "I'm just not sure that what Lithia wants is even possible."
5/4/25 5:12:18a Phroon says, "He brushes us off quite a bit too, to be honest."
5/4/25 5:12:18a Garr says, "He's a jerk, he wont give me any moonstones to play with"
5/4/25 5:12:18a Inu Teisei says, "no all baubles"
5/4/25 5:12:19a Inu Teisei says, "no fake fanciness"
5/4/25 5:12:19a Dandelion says, "He tinks a lot"
5/4/25 5:12:19a Brooke Britney says, "Baubles can help one's inner fanciness radiate outward."
5/4/25 5:12:20a (Garr nods)
5/4/25 5:12:20a Inu Teisei says, "we want tons of jewels"
5/4/25 5:12:21a Brooke Britney says, "But yes, if you'd have a word with Hekus."
5/4/25 5:12:21a Kevas ponders, "extra radiation, noted."
5/4/25 5:12:21a Dandelion says, "Sparkles are nice"
5/4/25 5:12:21a Dinsdale is sharing experiences with you.
5/4/25 5:12:22a Warawonda asks, "should we go talk tohim now?"
5/4/25 5:12:22a Inu Teisei says, "what about different spots on the fountain when rubbed would imbue that gems power for a day"
5/4/25 5:12:22a Dandelion asks, "Whaddya want us to have a word about?"
5/4/25 5:12:22a Brooke Britney says, "As friends who are concerned that this fountain needs to be really impressive."
5/4/25 5:12:23a Seaforth ponders, "who is Hekus?"
5/4/25 5:12:23a Brooke Britney asks, "And … magical?"
5/4/25 5:12:23a Dandelion says, "Mm hmm"
5/4/25 5:12:23a Inu Teisei says, "yes"
5/4/25 5:12:23a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:12:25a You concentrate on sending your message to Seaforth.
5/4/25 5:12:25a You think to Seaforth, "the one you let you become a healer"
5/4/25 5:12:25a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar looks edgy but doesn't do anything.
5/4/25 5:12:25a Dandelion asks, "What? Now? Or 'ventually?"
5/4/25 5:12:25a Brooke Britney asks, "Well, are you all just going to stand there?"
5/4/25 5:12:25a (Phroon looks at the selenite crystal atop his asklepian staff.)
5/4/25 5:12:26a Brooke Britney says, "It's a wonder anything gets done in this town."
5/4/25 5:12:26a Inu Teisei says, "yes"
5/4/25 5:12:26a Garr ponders, "The guy who makes you a healer Seaforth"
5/4/25 5:12:26a Brooke Britney says, "You'd think I had to carve the stone myself."
5/4/25 5:12:27a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:12:27a Dandelion exclaims, "Heyers, Master Hekus!"
5/4/25 5:12:28a Master Hekus says, "Greetings, Lady Dandelion."
5/4/25 5:12:28a Garr reads a scroll.
5/4/25 5:12:29a Dandelion says, "Sorry t'innerupt yer tinkin'"
5/4/25 5:12:30a Master Hekus asks, "What's with the mob?"
5/4/25 5:12:30a Garr ponders, "hrm"
5/4/25 5:12:30a Seaforth asks, "what is this place?"
5/4/25 5:12:36a (Master Hekus notices Brooke.)
5/4/25 5:12:36a Dandelion says, "Well, Brooke here's doin' some town renos"
5/4/25 5:12:37a Master Hekus says, "Oh Gaia..."
5/4/25 5:12:38a Cecil asks, "has anyone ever noticed heres only a "Master?" Why is he giving us ANY advice??"
5/4/25 5:12:40a Master Hekus exclaims, "For the last time, it's not possible!"
5/4/25 5:12:53a Dandelion says, "An' she has someting special tought up"
5/4/25 5:13:09a Cecil asks, "why is he not Lord Hekus?"
5/4/25 5:13:09a Brooke Britney says, "I think we got off on the wrong foot."
5/4/25 5:13:09a Master Hekus says, "First, you'd need an inordinate amount of selenite."
5/4/25 5:13:10a Brooke Britney exclaims, "The selenite is being collected!"
5/4/25 5:13:10a Master Hekus asks, "And second, how are you going to keep it supplied with blood?"
5/4/25 5:13:10a Crunch says, "I don't think he's ever given anyone a training ledger"
5/4/25 5:13:11a Dandelion says, "We're purdy good at inordinate"
5/4/25 5:13:11a Kalian says, "I've been collecting that much"
5/4/25 5:13:11a Master Hekus exclaims, "I don't want to think about it!"
5/4/25 5:13:11a Inu Teisei ponders, "LA members?"
5/4/25 5:13:11a Brooke Britney says, "Blood, yes! Well, there's lots of that."
5/4/25 5:13:11a Seaforth exclaims, "wait - no! No blood!"
5/4/25 5:13:12a Brooke Britney says, "But they're thinking of perhaps going with the second option."
5/4/25 5:13:12a Seaforth says, "Hold up."
5/4/25 5:13:13a Inu Teisei says, "everyone chant blood blood blood"
5/4/25 5:13:13a Warawonda ponders, "connected to the blood pool"
5/4/25 5:13:13a Master Hekus asks, "You want to use *water*?"
5/4/25 5:13:13a (Dandelion nods)
5/4/25 5:13:13a Dandelion says, "Yes, please"
5/4/25 5:13:14a Phroon says, "Yes please."
5/4/25 5:13:14a (Brooke Britney shrugs delicately.)
5/4/25 5:13:14a Master Hekus exclaims, "That's even more impossible than blood!"
5/4/25 5:13:14a Inu Teisei says, "yes connected to blood pool"
5/4/25 5:13:14a Inu Teisei says, "as a deposit box"
5/4/25 5:13:15a Dandelion asks, "Do you really mean impossible?"
5/4/25 5:13:15a Warawonda asks, "what would be possiable?"
5/4/25 5:13:16a Phroon asks, "Or just really difficult?"
5/4/25 5:13:16a Brooke Britney says, "But if you were going to try it,"
5/4/25 5:13:16a Dandelion asks, "To difficult an' bovversome?"
5/4/25 5:13:16a Master Hekus says, "Improbable, at best."
5/4/25 5:13:17a Brooke Britney says, "Improbable is good."
5/4/25 5:13:17a Crunch asks, "Don't you have a water fountain inside the temple somewhere?"
5/4/25 5:13:17a Dandelion exclaims, "But tink about how pretty it would be!"
5/4/25 5:13:17a Garr exclaims, "Maybe we can collect enough water from the shadowspring source? That might have some extra healing properties to help the fountain be great!"
5/4/25 5:13:17a Warawonda asks, "how would you do it?"
5/4/25 5:13:18a Inu Teisei ponders, "what we needs is a LA™ Architect"
5/4/25 5:13:18a Kevas says, "Ah, well, that's a different chest of fish entirely."
5/4/25 5:13:18a Kevas asks, "But is it wise?"
5/4/25 5:13:19a Seaforth says, "We live on an island that is constantly covered in puddles of water."
5/4/25 5:13:20a Master Hekus says, "You can't just use one source."
5/4/25 5:13:20a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:13:20a (Inu Teisei perks up her ears at the readinf of shadow)
5/4/25 5:13:21a (Inu Teisei perks up her ears at the reading of shadow)
5/4/25 5:13:21a Brooke Britney asks, "Do you mean it would be impossible to just use one?"
5/4/25 5:13:21a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar practices cackling.
5/4/25 5:13:21a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar sings Inu Teisei a song woven from shadows.
5/4/25 5:13:23a Master Hekus says, "Extremely impossible."
5/4/25 5:13:23a Warawonda ponders, "perhaps lugubrion know a way?"
5/4/25 5:13:24a Inu Teisei ponders, "ya brion's can solve anything"
5/4/25 5:13:24a Master Hekus says, "If you used at least 3 sources you could move it down to highly unlikely."
5/4/25 5:13:25a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:13:25a Master Hekus says, "And they'd have to be infused with moon energy."
5/4/25 5:13:26a Dandelion says, "It has been a while, but remember yer adventurous streak, Master Hekus? You love a challenge"
5/4/25 5:13:26a Brooke Britney asks, "Could you just infuse it yourself?"
5/4/25 5:13:26a Master Hekus exclaims, "I can't think of three sources that infused!"
5/4/25 5:13:27a Master Hekus says, "Infuse it my..."
5/4/25 5:13:27a Brooke Britney says, "Everyone knows you're on good terms with the Moon."
5/4/25 5:13:27a Inu Teisei says, "sunstones"
5/4/25 5:13:27a Crunch ponders, "Is this guy a healer, or a mason?"
5/4/25 5:13:27a Master Hekus asks, "What do you think we're doing here, exactly!?"
5/4/25 5:13:28a (Dandelion smiles)
5/4/25 5:13:28a Brooke Britney says, "I'm not clear on that point."
5/4/25 5:13:28a Seaforth says, "I have flogged many builders in my time, and this man does not look like a builder."
5/4/25 5:13:29a Master Hekus says, "You want a self-sustaining healing enhancing fountain in the middle of town."
5/4/25 5:13:30a Brooke Britney asks, "Wow, do you think we can do all that?"
5/4/25 5:13:30a Inu Teisei says, "with a comm node attached"
5/4/25 5:13:30a Dandelion exclaims, "Wouldn't it be lovely!"
5/4/25 5:13:31a Master Hekus exclaims, "You'd need 10 healers constantlty working to keep that infused if you used plain water!"
5/4/25 5:13:31a Garr thinks, "Lore Tour is in the healer hall for anyone late"
5/4/25 5:13:31a Inu Teisei says, "so pretty sungems"
5/4/25 5:13:32a Dandelion asks, "CAn we find some fancy water t'use?"
5/4/25 5:13:32a Crunch asks, "Fewer healers if it were blood, eh?"
5/4/25 5:13:32a Cecil says, "Connie would like a fountain that spouts beer"
5/4/25 5:13:33a Garr exclaims, "Shadowspring water. That stuff already has properties to help with growth of life!"
5/4/25 5:13:33a Master Hekus exclaims, "Oh much fewer. Blood simplifies it greatly!"
5/4/25 5:13:33a Warawonda asks, "what if we super charged moonstone using ethrial power?"
5/4/25 5:13:33a (Seaforth despairs)
5/4/25 5:13:33a Ravenstorm asks, "so who do we need to kill to get what we need?"
5/4/25 5:13:33a Shadowfire ponders, "What if we used some kind of focusing crystals?"
5/4/25 5:13:34a Haffron says, "I heard that Hekus likes Moonshine..."
5/4/25 5:13:34a Master Hekus says, "But it's still impossible."
5/4/25 5:13:34a Kevas ponders, "Healing with blood seems counterproductive"
5/4/25 5:13:34a Brooke Britney asks, "Could we combine the two plans? A little bit of blood in the water?"
5/4/25 5:13:35a Dandelion says, "Ick"
5/4/25 5:13:35a (Phroon frowns)
5/4/25 5:13:35a Katreesa says, "blood and fire...."
5/4/25 5:13:36a Seaforth says, "Lord Ravenstorm asking the important questions."
5/4/25 5:13:36a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:13:36a (Katreesa sings a little tune to herself)
5/4/25 5:13:37a Noivad growls, "sounds like a bad time"
5/4/25 5:13:37a Inu Teisei thinks, "what if we's gots Master Hekus drunk on Moonshine?"
5/4/25 5:13:38a Brooke Britney asks, "So you need them to bring barrels of this moon-infused water back to town?"
5/4/25 5:13:39a Master Hekus says, "Well first you'd have to find it. Yes."
5/4/25 5:13:39a Brooke Britney says, "Shadowspring sounds icky."
5/4/25 5:13:39a Inu Teisei thinks, "then Hekus will stop wearing wah wah glasses and be like OKAY!"
5/4/25 5:13:40a Seaforth asks, "And we have to kill someone, I suppose?"
5/4/25 5:13:41a Phroon says, "I've got a barrel of Shadowspring water rattling around in storage that I've been saving just in case."
5/4/25 5:13:41a Inu Teisei ponders, "Brooke where's your sense of adventure?"
5/4/25 5:13:41a Brooke Britney exclaims, "Ah, splendid!"
5/4/25 5:13:41a Garr exclaims, "We don't have to go inside! they didn't have a builder like you Brooke so it's already leaking out the side!"
5/4/25 5:13:42a Ravenstorm pulls a bowl of spicy blephat wing soup out of his lunchbox, and chews it with evident pleasure.
5/4/25 5:13:42a Dandelion says, "Dere's nice water inna mushump hut. Makes nice potions"
5/4/25 5:13:42a Brooke Britney asks, "Are there any other places aligned with the moon?"
5/4/25 5:13:43a Phroon says, "Could at least check it out, see if it's what we need or not."
5/4/25 5:13:43a Brooke Britney says, "Surely."
5/4/25 5:13:44a Ravenstorm says, "hmm"
5/4/25 5:13:44a Master Hekus says, "I suppose I could look at it."
5/4/25 5:13:44a Garr says, "The waterfall might have some good water"
5/4/25 5:13:44a (Master Hekus sighs.)
5/4/25 5:13:44a Ravenstorm says, "KI is but KI is rough"
5/4/25 5:13:44a (Brooke Britney nods.)
5/4/25 5:13:44a (Dandelion smiles)
5/4/25 5:13:44a (Phroon goes to talk to the storage dwarves.)
5/4/25 5:13:45a Master Hekus ponders, "If it'll get these people out of here faster."
5/4/25 5:13:45a (Brooke Britney consults her notes from Lithia.)
5/4/25 5:13:45a Dandelion exclaims, "It's time you got some freish air anyway!"
5/4/25 5:13:46a Brooke Britney asks, "There may be a couple waterfalls that qualify for that statement, yes?"
5/4/25 5:13:46a (Garr nods)
5/4/25 5:13:46a Seaforth says, "There is a lovely hot tub in the fighter hall. Lion-O gets all of his potion water there."
5/4/25 5:13:47a Dandelion says, "C'mon! It'll be fun"
5/4/25 5:13:47a Noivad growls, "ya master H you are always in here, you need vitamin d"
5/4/25 5:13:47a Brooke Britney says, "I've never been invited to one of the fighter hot tub parties."
5/4/25 5:13:48a Brooke Britney asks, "Can anyone score me an invitation?"
5/4/25 5:13:49a Seaforth says, "Not if you get blood in the tub"
5/4/25 5:13:50a Brooke Britney says, "You're fighters, I'm quite certain there is already blood in the tub."
5/4/25 5:13:51a Brooke Britney says, "I'm sorry no one told you."
5/4/25 5:13:51a Master Hekus says, "You're wasting your time though (and more importantly mine)."
5/4/25 5:13:51a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:13:53a Brooke Britney says, "Between you and me, Hekky, they're not exactly efficient builders."
5/4/25 5:13:53a Master Hekus says, "There is no way the water could keep an infusion long enough, even if you could collect enough barrels."
5/4/25 5:13:54a Phroon shows his barrel of water to everyone.
5/4/25 5:13:54a Shadowfire asks, "What about some kind of... resonant amplifier?"
5/4/25 5:13:54a Phroon fills his bottle with water from his barrel.
5/4/25 5:13:54a Ravenstorm says, "one step at a time"
5/4/25 5:13:54a Garr asks, "I was thinking about the one in the eastern mountains, but the one coming out from Sarra may have some beneficial properties. Have you seen the size of that Plesio'don?"
5/4/25 5:13:55a Haffron asks, "Does the water at Shadowspring Citadel have much potential?"
5/4/25 5:13:55a (Master Hekus takes a look.)
5/4/25 5:13:56a (Phroon offers Hekus the bottle of shadowspring water)
5/4/25 5:13:56a Master Hekus ponders, "huh! That's potent stuff."
5/4/25 5:13:56a Haffron ponders, "phroon probably still has a bottle"
5/4/25 5:13:56a Haffron says, "yea"
5/4/25 5:13:56a Master Hekus asks, "How long have you had this?"
5/4/25 5:13:56a Dandelion ponders, "Git 'im outside an' he'll get all innerested."
5/4/25 5:13:57a Phroon says, "Uh… quite a few years."
5/4/25 5:13:58a Haffron ponders, "3 years?"
5/4/25 5:13:58a Master Hekus asks, "Years!?"
5/4/25 5:13:58a Inu Teisei ponders, "i have a jar of shine here"
5/4/25 5:13:59a Garr ponders, "gross"
5/4/25 5:13:59a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:14:00a Haffron says, "or longer"
5/4/25 5:14:02a Master Hekus asks, "Not last week?"
5/4/25 5:14:03a (Master Hekus frowns.)
5/4/25 5:14:04a Dandelion says, "Years"
5/4/25 5:14:04a Master Hekus exclaims, "That's impossible!"
5/4/25 5:14:05a Seaforth says, "What if its just water and it heals people by making them not thirsty"
5/4/25 5:14:07a Inu Teisei says, "no such thing as shadow algae"
5/4/25 5:14:07a Katreesa says, "aged like a fine wine"
5/4/25 5:14:08a Dandelion says, "Improbable at best"
5/4/25 5:14:08a Haffron ponders, "Garr is a judgy hoarder."
5/4/25 5:14:09a Garr exclaims, "Oh maybe that means it's some good stuff!"
5/4/25 5:14:10a Dandelion says, "But true."
5/4/25 5:14:12a (Master Hekus frowns.)
5/4/25 5:14:14a Noivad growls, "shadowplane water"
5/4/25 5:14:15a Master Hekus says, "Well... if that's true. And I doubt it is."
5/4/25 5:14:16a Haffron ponders, "Could mix some of Garr's gems in it... we should grind those up."
5/4/25 5:14:16a Master Hekus says, "This insane plan may work."
5/4/25 5:14:16a Dandelion exclaims, "It is!"
5/4/25 5:14:18a Brooke Britney says, "Now you're getting their hopes up."
5/4/25 5:14:19a Master Hekus says, "If you could get enough barrels, from enough different sources."
5/4/25 5:14:47a Kevas ponders, "insane we can do. That's a speciality."
5/4/25 5:14:48a Master Hekus says, "And enough selenite. Don't forget that."
5/4/25 5:14:49a Brooke Britney asks, "Sources aligned with the Moon?"
5/4/25 5:15:03a Shadowfire ponders, "What if we used selenite crystals in the pipe linings or the pool tiling?"
5/4/25 5:15:04a Master Hekus says, "You're going to need so much selenite."
5/4/25 5:15:08a (Phroon nods.)
5/4/25 5:15:08a Warawonda says, "hmmm"
5/4/25 5:15:09a Noivad says, "hi Jeeps"
5/4/25 5:15:10a Jeepers says, "Hi."
5/4/25 5:15:11a Master Hekus says, "Well, I don't think I'd sign off on this plan. But if you wanted to try it"
5/4/25 5:15:11a Kevas asks, "How much is "so much"?"
5/4/25 5:15:11a Brooke Britney asks, "Would the ancient machines be a good clue for where to gather this moon-infused water?"
5/4/25 5:15:11a Master Hekus says, "It has maybe a 5% chance of working."
5/4/25 5:15:11a Ravenstorm says, "what about the watersource by the selenite spawn spot on metz"
5/4/25 5:15:11a Brooke Britney says, "I'll handle the paperwork, Hekus."
5/4/25 5:15:11a Ravenstorm says, "hmm"
5/4/25 5:15:11a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:15:12a Seaforth says, "We could use lead! That is cheap AND ductile."
5/4/25 5:15:12a Warawonda ponders, "master hekus your name is cut off"
5/4/25 5:15:12a Garr says, "There's also that hotspring in the FC too. There's something odd about that water that I could never wrap my head around."
5/4/25 5:15:12a Brooke Britney says, "No need to sign anything."
5/4/25 5:15:12a Ravenstorm says, "so many options"
5/4/25 5:15:12a Brooke Britney says, "Permits is a friend."
5/4/25 5:15:13a Jeepers is sharing experiences with you.
5/4/25 5:15:13a Ravenstorm says, "ster Hekus"
5/4/25 5:15:14a Phroon says, "Ah, some of those are moon-aligned"
5/4/25 5:15:14a Katreesa asks, "oh, are we still here?"
5/4/25 5:15:14a Brooke Britney ponders, "Lead plumbing? What could go wrong."
5/4/25 5:15:15a Master Hekus says, "Yes, for some reason you are still here."
5/4/25 5:15:16a Katreesa says, "darn"
5/4/25 5:15:16a (Dandelion smiles fondly at Master Hekus)
5/4/25 5:15:16a Ravenstorm says, "where to"
5/4/25 5:15:16a Seaforth says, "We are debating the merits of different types of water."
5/4/25 5:15:16a Brooke Britney says, "I'm sure we have just about what we need from you, Master Hekus."
5/4/25 5:15:17a Katreesa says, "zzzzzzzz"
5/4/25 5:15:18a Katreesa says, ":P"
5/4/25 5:15:39a Brooke Britney asks, "And may I say the Puddleby Civic Beautification Society is honored to have your assistance in this endeavor?"
5/4/25 5:15:39a Dandelion asks, "Sure you don't want to come onna adventure t'day?"
5/4/25 5:15:41a (Phroon thinks…)
5/4/25 5:15:42a Master Hekus says, "Adventure? I'm much too experienced for that."
5/4/25 5:15:43a Inu Teisei ponders, "so old and feeble, check"
5/4/25 5:15:43a Dandelion asks, "Uh huh. What was dat trip to da Abysses?"
5/4/25 5:15:44a Master Hekus says, "Exactly."
5/4/25 5:15:44a Seaforth asks, "Splendid. Everyone have your servants grab a bucket and we will head off to... ?"
5/4/25 5:15:44a Phroon says, "Where is moon aligned…"
5/4/25 5:15:45a Dandelion asks, "Fact-findin' expedition?"
5/4/25 5:15:45a Garr exclaims, "melted Abyssal ice could be a nice source of water too!"
5/4/25 5:15:45a (Seaforth waits for a location)
5/4/25 5:15:46a Phroon asks, "Windweft Ice cave?"
5/4/25 5:15:46a Cecil says, "lo"
5/4/25 5:15:46a (Aneides waves)
5/4/25 5:15:46a (Brooke Britney curtseys to Aneides.)
5/4/25 5:15:46a (Warawonda nods)
5/4/25 5:15:47a Phroon says, "Not much liquid water there"
5/4/25 5:15:47a Kevas says, "Blocks of ice are probably easier to transport than liquid water."
5/4/25 5:15:48a Warawonda says, "but there is"
5/4/25 5:15:48a Katreesa asks, "mushroom hut in town?"
5/4/25 5:15:48a Brooke Britney ponders, "Sounds heavy."
5/4/25 5:15:48a Kevas says, "Unless we have an aqueduct I'm not aware of."
5/4/25 5:15:48a Seaforth asks, "What about the, uh, Heart of Ice?"
5/4/25 5:15:49a Noivad says, "there the bear cave waters"
5/4/25 5:15:49a Katreesa says, "not that again"
5/4/25 5:15:50a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:15:50a Warawonda says, "unless you want water from erthiral plane"
5/4/25 5:15:50a (Katreesa giggles)
5/4/25 5:15:50a (Garr wanders off to buy a couple barrels)
5/4/25 5:15:50a Dandelion says, "We didn't find it yet, did we? (I use "we" loosely here)"
5/4/25 5:15:51a (Brooke Britney politely exits Hekus' antechamber.)
5/4/25 5:15:51a Warawonda says, "i think there a puddle in bloodmages part"
5/4/25 5:15:51a Haffron says, "Could tether Frozen Spring Water from the Ice Cave or Tenebrion's cave..."
5/4/25 5:15:51a Katreesa says, "Lundar's"
5/4/25 5:15:52a Katreesa says, "or whatever"
5/4/25 5:15:52a Seaforth asks, "Just to be clear, we are going to run this fountain on water from BUCKETS?"
5/4/25 5:15:52a (Crunch headbutts Hekus on the way out, for good measure)
5/4/25 5:15:52a Dandelion exclaims, "Tank you, Master Hekus!"
5/4/25 5:15:52a (Master Hekus n ods.)
5/4/25 5:15:53a (Phroon looks lost)
5/4/25 5:15:53a Seaforth yells, "I found some"
5/4/25 5:15:54a Katreesa says, "oh good lord, don't follow me"
5/4/25 5:15:54a (Seaforth points)
5/4/25 5:15:54a Seaforth says, "water."
5/4/25 5:15:55a Dandelion says, "Dat's a puddle, Seafort"
5/4/25 5:15:55a Cecil says, "lol"
5/4/25 5:15:55a Kevas says, "pose leanright"
5/4/25 5:15:55a Phroon says, "I don't think this is going to be quite that easy, Seaforth."
5/4/25 5:15:55a (Aneides grins)
5/4/25 5:15:56a Cecil says, "Puddleforth"
5/4/25 5:15:56a (Seaforth pokes)
5/4/25 5:15:57a Crunch asks, "How about where the uli flowers grow, wouldn't that be good water?"
5/4/25 5:15:57a Ravenstorm asks, "selenite and water source is metz is it not?"
5/4/25 5:15:58a Warawonda asks, "did any one ask witch soruces?"
5/4/25 5:15:58a (Phroon looks at his full pack)
5/4/25 5:15:59a Haffron asks, "Slates has a river?"
5/4/25 5:15:59a Ravenstorm says, "hard to pinpoint specificially the area we need to go"
5/4/25 5:15:59a Garr says, "The metz river cave could be a nice source"
5/4/25 5:15:59a Haffron asks, "But is the river near the Selenite source?"
5/4/25 5:16:00a Haffron ponders, "probably metz yea"
5/4/25 5:16:00a Garr ponders, "I got some"
5/4/25 5:16:01a Phroon says, "The other moon-aligned places are the Foghaven Waterfall…"
5/4/25 5:16:01a Phroon says, "Shadowspring Itself…"
5/4/25 5:16:02a Ravenstorm says, "and shadowplane waterfall"
5/4/25 5:16:03a Ravenstorm says, "maybe one in the same"
5/4/25 5:16:03a Phroon says, "And then the spot down the river…"
5/4/25 5:16:03a Garr says, "There's the pool at S metz that is directly over a moon aligned spot too"
5/4/25 5:16:04a Dandelion asks, "Oh?"
5/4/25 5:16:04a Shadowmutt growls, "Zzzzzz."
5/4/25 5:16:05a Katreesa says, "that sounds likely"
5/4/25 5:16:05a You have 7964 coins.
5/4/25 5:16:05a Jeepers asks, "Wara, what do your high IQ eyes see?"
5/4/25 5:16:06a Koppi yells, "Kyoko reports: Two moons ago, a portal was opened in south forest over the face of the land, and squib emerged saying "ah, my kingdom" and such it was in the tempest lands of puddleby,"
5/4/25 5:16:06a Noivad says, "we could breeze through metz"
5/4/25 5:16:06a Haffron says, "Selenite infused water"
5/4/25 5:16:06a Jeepers says, "Oh SHIT CRUNCH"
5/4/25 5:16:06a Aneides says, "oh"
5/4/25 5:16:07a (Crunch headbutts Jeepers)
5/4/25 5:16:07a Aneides asks, "Doesn't that *have* to be Metz?"

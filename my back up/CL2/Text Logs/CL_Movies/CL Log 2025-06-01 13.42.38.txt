6/1/25 1:45:43p Izax ponders, "Some mastery and some loss"
6/1/25 1:45:43p Xepel says, "Some of the mystics definitely play with the weather more than they probably should"
6/1/25 1:45:43p • You hear Coriakin's music...
6/1/25 1:45:43p Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
6/1/25 1:45:43p (Coriakin): "Praise Midnight"
6/1/25 1:45:44p Kani asks, "Chaining To The Safe Cave?"

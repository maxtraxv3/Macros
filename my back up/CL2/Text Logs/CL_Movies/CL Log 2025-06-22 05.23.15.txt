6/22/25 5:34:04a Naferu disappears into the forest.

6/22/25 5:34:05a Garr exclaims, "I have training!"
6/22/25 5:34:05a (Abox looks anxious)
6/22/25 5:34:05a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:34:05a Phroon says, "I think we lost a few"
6/22/25 5:34:05a Kani asks, "Does that work, Brisk?"
6/22/25 5:34:05a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:34:05a Garr says, "Just not pathfinding training"
6/22/25 5:34:05a Brisk says, "no"
6/22/25 5:34:05a Trillbane says, "Hail, Warawonda. You need training before I can teach you."
6/22/25 5:34:05a Trillbane says, "Hail, Warawonda. You need training before I can teach you."
6/22/25 5:34:05a Trillbane says, "Hail, Warawonda. You need training before I can teach you."
6/22/25 5:34:06a (Kani giggles.)
6/22/25 5:34:06a Trillbane says, "Hail, Warawonda. You need training before I can teach you."

6/22/25 5:34:06a (Abox looks for Dandelion)
6/22/25 5:34:06a Tia asks, "Seaforth?"
6/22/25 5:34:07a You pick up an orga eye.
6/22/25 5:34:07a Tia says, "I think he might've been Razzia'd"
6/22/25 5:34:07a You drop your orga eye.
6/22/25 5:34:07a (Eirian Caldwell chuckles.)
6/22/25 5:34:08a Noivad yells, "trin pf if ya got him"
6/22/25 5:34:08a Dandelion asks, "Seafort?"
6/22/25 5:34:08a Phroon exclaims, "&#*$!"
6/22/25 5:34:09a Tia says, "But Raven wasn't chainable"
6/22/25 5:34:09a Trillbane says, "Hail, Ravenstorm. You need training before I can teach you."

6/22/25 5:34:10a Dandelion says, "Seafort"
6/22/25 5:34:10a Inu Teisei asks, "sat up?"
6/22/25 5:34:10a (Mr Pudding): * The sky is somewhat cloudy, and you can see storm clouds to the northwest. You can see that it is after midnight.
6/22/25 5:34:10a Trillbane says, "Hail, Naferu. There is nothing I can teach you."
6/22/25 5:34:10a Trillbane says, "Hail, Naferu. There is nothing I can teach you."

6/22/25 5:34:10a Katreesa says, "sorry, figured I should get out while I could"
6/22/25 5:34:11a Trillbane says, "Hello hello."
6/22/25 5:34:11a (Eirian Caldwell laughs.)
6/22/25 5:34:11a Ravenstorm says, "im the pf noob of all noobs"
6/22/25 5:34:11a Mr Pudding shows his waterproof cloak to everyone.
6/22/25 5:34:12a Garr exclaims, "Hi Trillbane!"
6/22/25 5:34:12a Inu Teisei says, "where is sea/"
6/22/25 5:34:12a (Biro purrs)
6/22/25 5:34:12a Katreesa says, "saw you guys down, and didn't know what could do that"
6/22/25 5:34:12a Inu Teisei asks, "where is sea?"
6/22/25 5:34:12a Naferu growls, "was seaforth e?"
6/22/25 5:34:12a Coriakin asks, "How are you, Trillbane?"
6/22/25 5:34:13a Garr says, "Sorry for showing up unnanounced"
6/22/25 5:34:13a Inu Teisei says, "sat mutt well past"
6/22/25 5:34:14a Mr Pudding picks up an orga eye.
6/22/25 5:34:14a Inu Teisei says, "sig sat"
6/22/25 5:34:14a Sativa says, "toasty"
6/22/25 5:34:15a Trillbane says, "I never announce myself."
6/22/25 5:34:15a (Coriakin grins)
6/22/25 5:34:15a (Phroon chuckles.)
6/22/25 5:34:15a Ravenstorm says, "very modest of you sir"
6/22/25 5:34:16a Coriakin says, "Showing up unannounced is the Puddleby way, after all"
6/22/25 5:34:16a Biro ponders, "he probably heard our screams from the entry"
6/22/25 5:34:16a Sativa exclaims, "hooray!"
6/22/25 5:34:16a Sativa exclaims, "thank you!"
6/22/25 5:34:16a Eirian Caldwell asks, "if we drop an oe on Sat, will it help?"
6/22/25 5:34:17a Coriakin says, "Just drop in and say hi"
6/22/25 5:34:17a (Eirian Caldwell grins.)
6/22/25 5:34:17a Trillbane says, "I've found it interferes with my ability to find hidden ways."
6/22/25 5:34:17a Ravenstorm says, "pls thank your healers and mystics"
6/22/25 5:34:17a Sativa says, "I am wearing one :D"
6/22/25 5:34:17a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:34:18a Trillbane says, "Just imagine:"
6/22/25 5:34:18a Mr Pudding asks in Thoom, "oh, this the nimble-toes?"
6/22/25 5:34:18a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:34:18a Sativa says, "more cant hurt I guess"
6/22/25 5:34:18a Palmeri asks, "well now what?"
6/22/25 5:34:18a Trillbane yells, "Here comes Trillbane! Please point your lightning elsewhere."
6/22/25 5:34:18a Mr Pudding says in Thoom, "quaint."
6/22/25 5:34:19a (Coriakin grins)
6/22/25 5:34:19a (Phroon laughs)
6/22/25 5:34:19a Coriakin says, "You have a point"
6/22/25 5:34:19a Inu Teisei ponders, "he's says he's been looking but has he really?"
6/22/25 5:34:19a (Abox's ears swivel to the front)
6/22/25 5:34:20a Garr asks, "Does that work?"
6/22/25 5:34:20a Trillbane says, "No."
6/22/25 5:34:20a Garr exclaims, "I could try that!"
6/22/25 5:34:20a Phroon says, "No,"
6/22/25 5:34:20a Coriakin says, "Actually, we're dropping in because we have a challenge for you"
6/22/25 5:34:21a Garr says, "Oh"
6/22/25 5:35:32a (Garr sighs)
6/22/25 5:35:32a Trillbane says, "A challenge? I have never been bested."
6/22/25 5:35:33a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:35:34a Palmeri says, "so humble"
6/22/25 5:35:34a Mr Pudding ponders, "hah"
6/22/25 5:35:34a Trillbane asks, "But what of your Lord Seaforth?"
6/22/25 5:35:34a Sativa asks, "yes, but have you ben worsted?"
6/22/25 5:35:35a Eirian Caldwell exclaims, "!"
6/22/25 5:35:35a Inu Teisei asks, "who?"
6/22/25 5:35:35a (Phroon looks worried.)
6/22/25 5:35:35a Tia says, "I think Seaforth might've been Razzia'd. If we want to grab him, it'd be clearing the whole snell"
6/22/25 5:35:36a Mr Pudding ponders, ""find out" phase"
6/22/25 5:35:36a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:35:36a Coriakin asks, "We will need to go collect him. Unless you know a shortcut?"
6/22/25 5:35:36a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:35:37a Trillbane says, "I know many shortcuts, but I doubt the likes of you would be able to follow."
6/22/25 5:35:37a (Trillbane peers at Coriakin.)
6/22/25 5:35:37a Inu Teisei says, "hmm"
6/22/25 5:35:37a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:35:38a (Inu Teisei): Challenge Accepted
6/22/25 5:35:38a Coriakin says, "I'm still working through one of the books"
6/22/25 5:35:38a Trillbane says, "You look like you don't know much about this sort of thing at all."
6/22/25 5:35:39a Garr exclaims, "I'm a great follower!"
6/22/25 5:35:39a Eirian Caldwell says, "my goodness"
6/22/25 5:35:39a Coriakin exclaims, "I certainly don't, that's why we've come to the best for assistance!"
6/22/25 5:35:40a Palmeri says, "I know a little... but i just love stabbing things more"
6/22/25 5:35:40a Inu Teisei asks, "You trained me fully Trill, so what's your excuse now?"
6/22/25 5:35:40a Coriakin asks, "But should we collect Seaforth first, everyone?"
6/22/25 5:35:40a Eirian Caldwell says, "perhaps if you showed the way, and we stuck very close"
6/22/25 5:35:41a Trillbane asks, "So, the challenge was to collect Lord Seaforth?"
6/22/25 5:35:41a Mr Pudding ponders, "dont say microtransactions...."
6/22/25 5:35:41a Dandelion says, "Yes, please"
6/22/25 5:35:41a Biro growls, "you can't teach talent like Trill's!"
6/22/25 5:35:41a Coriakin says, "No, far more interesting than that"
6/22/25 5:35:42a Phroon says, "That's more of a qualifying round."
6/22/25 5:35:42a Garr says, "That's just the incentive to entice you"
6/22/25 5:35:42a Dandelion says, "Dat is but a warm-up"
6/22/25 5:35:42a Trillbane says, "Ah. I'll let him be, then."
6/22/25 5:35:43a Coriakin says, "Inu, he's taught us everything we know, but not everything he knows."
6/22/25 5:35:43a (Dandelion frowns)
6/22/25 5:35:44a Coriakin asks, "Phroon? What do you think?"
6/22/25 5:35:45a Phroon says, "I've never seen that snell cleared"
6/22/25 5:35:45a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "what was the other challenge?"
6/22/25 5:35:45a Coriakin asks, "Out to save Seaforth or ask Trillbane for assistance?"
6/22/25 5:35:46a Mr Pudding says in Thoom, "Two things in life: Dont tell everything you know"
6/22/25 5:35:46a (Trillbane nods to Mr. Pudding.)
6/22/25 5:35:46a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
6/22/25 5:35:47a Trillbane says in People, "Make them buy the book."
6/22/25 5:35:47a * You feel mentally enhanced by Valadorei...
6/22/25 5:35:47a Phroon says, "Assistance would be appreciated"
6/22/25 5:35:48a 'trillaa' is not in the lands.
6/22/25 5:35:48a Trillbane says in People, "Ah, in that case."
6/22/25 5:35:48a Coriakin says, "Well, if you're offering to collect Seaforth for us, Trillbane, we'd gratefully accept a display of your prowess"
6/22/25 5:35:48a Dandelion says, "Yes, it would"
6/22/25 5:35:48a Eirian Caldwell asks, "I wonder how much we would need to pay?"
6/22/25 5:35:48a 'trill' is not in the lands.
6/22/25 5:35:48a Coriakin says, "... we'd gratefully accept a display of your prowess"
6/22/25 5:35:49a Trillbane says, "A small demonstration of my prowess might not be amiss."
6/22/25 5:35:49a (Coriakin takes out his shadow-mottled harp.)
6/22/25 5:35:50a Trillbane ponders, "Truly, he's been cribbing my lines."
6/22/25 5:35:50a (Coriakin): "Forest Cathedral" by Perkusi
6/22/25 5:35:50a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:35:51a Eirian Caldwell says, "I think we could should monetary appreciation, to offset further printing costs"
6/22/25 5:35:51a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
6/22/25 5:35:51a (Coriakin): "Forest Cathedral" by Perkusi
6/22/25 5:35:51a Mr Pudding reads a scroll.
6/22/25 5:35:52a Coriakin says, "m"
6/22/25 5:35:52a Trillbane slips into the trees, unnoticed.
6/22/25 5:35:53a (Kevas definitely did not notice that.)
6/22/25 5:35:53a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "truly a master"
6/22/25 5:35:55a (Coriakin smiles)
6/22/25 5:35:55a Phroon says, "Whew"
6/22/25 5:35:55a Kani ponders, "Teach me more."
6/22/25 5:35:56a Coriakin exclaims, "How did you do that?!"
6/22/25 5:35:56a Tia exclaims, "Thanks!"
6/22/25 5:35:56a Phroon says, "Thank you, Trillbane."
6/22/25 5:35:56a (Kevas did not notice that, either.)
6/22/25 5:35:56a Trillbane says, "The impossible is possible."
6/22/25 5:35:57a Eirian Caldwell exclaims, "very impressive!"
6/22/25 5:35:57a Coriakin says, "You were there one moment and then gone the next"
6/22/25 5:35:57a Seaforth says, "There were a significant number of Orga in there"
6/22/25 5:36:00a Coriakin says, "Truly, we've come to the right person"
6/22/25 5:36:00a Eirian Caldwell says, "he might be able to beat the next challenge, if he can do that"
6/22/25 5:36:00a Trillbane says, "Indubitably."
6/22/25 5:36:01a Palmeri says, "oh lord Seaforth"
6/22/25 5:36:02a Coriakin asks, "Trillbane, have you heard of Shadowspring Citadel?"
6/22/25 5:36:02a Seaforth says, "Hello"
6/22/25 5:36:02a Palmeri says, "Trillbane was saying the NICEST things about you"
6/22/25 5:36:02a Mr Pudding says, "Time not important; only life important"
6/22/25 5:36:03a Katreesa says, "det sea"
6/22/25 5:36:04a Trillbane says, "I merely noticed that your companions had given up on you."
6/22/25 5:36:04a You equip your Staff of Ballou.
6/22/25 5:36:04a You slip your Staff of Ballou into your backpack.
6/22/25 5:36:04a Seaforth says, "Good. People ought to say nice things about me."
6/22/25 5:36:05a Trillbane says, "They felt you had fallen into shadow."
6/22/25 5:36:05a Trillbane says, "That you were beyond retrieval by mortal means."
6/22/25 5:36:06a Kevas says, "Seaforth? No, he's very shiny."
6/22/25 5:36:06a Trillbane says, "But I assured them to fear not."
6/22/25 5:36:06a Palmeri asks, "all on Seaforth?"
6/22/25 5:36:06a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "not sure I would go that far"
6/22/25 5:36:06a Seaforth says, "Well, there were a lot of Orga"
6/22/25 5:36:07a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:36:07a (Dandelion): on
6/22/25 5:36:07a Trillbane says, "That it was a trifle for Trillbane."
6/22/25 5:36:08a Trillbane ponders, "As good a working title as any."
6/22/25 5:36:09a Seaforth says, "Also, I was waving a severed Orga eyeball at them, which made them mad."
6/22/25 5:36:09a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:36:09a (Abox kicks Seaforth up)
6/22/25 5:36:09a Trillbane says, "Alas, they were correct. It seems they cannot heal you."
6/22/25 5:36:10a Kevas ponders, "Sounds like a good cookbook."
6/22/25 5:36:10a Mr Pudding ponders, "whats this right here?"
6/22/25 5:36:10a Trillbane says, "We must commission a poem to remember you by."
6/22/25 5:36:10a Biro says, "seafried"
6/22/25 5:36:11a (Abox kicks Seaforth up again)
6/22/25 5:36:11a Eirian Caldwell says, "maybe a song :)"
6/22/25 5:36:11a Abox ponders, "this usually works"
6/22/25 5:36:12a Garr juggles his darkstone from one hand to the other.
6/22/25 5:36:12a Eirian Caldwell says, "since we have such fine bards"
6/22/25 5:36:12a • You hear Coriakin's music...
6/22/25 5:36:12a Coriakin starts playing his starbuck harp.
6/22/25 5:36:12a (Coriakin): "Journey’s End"
6/22/25 5:36:12a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:36:12a Seaforth says, "Trillbane, you remind me of someone. I can't place it."
6/22/25 5:36:13a (Kani tries to make the words rhyme)
6/22/25 5:36:13a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:36:14a Coriakin says, "Here lies Seaforth, his journey ended."
6/22/25 5:36:14a Kani says, "He was shiny"
6/22/25 5:36:14a Kani says, "His hair well-coiffed"
6/22/25 5:36:15a Kani says, "And in the storm"
6/22/25 5:36:15a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "shiny and chrome"
6/22/25 5:36:15a Coriakin says, "Until we get him back to the fountain in town, where he can be mended."
6/22/25 5:36:15a Kani says, "His lightning doffed"
6/22/25 5:36:15a Mr Pudding says, "squib heal sea"
6/22/25 5:36:15a (Abox checks his shoes)
6/22/25 5:36:15a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:36:15a Kani says, "His armor doffed"
6/22/25 5:36:16a (Coriakin grins at Kani)
6/22/25 5:36:16a Mr Pudding ponders, "o"
6/22/25 5:36:17a Coriakin says, "Anyway, before I get too distracted... the reason we came here"
6/22/25 5:36:18a (Phroon grins.)
6/22/25 5:36:18a Abox ponders, "guess it will just take longer than usual"
6/22/25 5:36:18a Coriakin asks, "Trillbane, have you heard of Shadowspring Citadel?"
6/22/25 5:36:18a Garr says, "He has too many titles, maybe if he gave some of his holdings to me it'd be easier to heal him"
6/22/25 5:36:19a Naferu growls, "tucked away to rot in a loft"
6/22/25 5:36:20a Trillbane says, "Certainly."
6/22/25 5:36:21a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:36:22a Trillbane says, "A few of my books had their origins there, I believe."
6/22/25 5:36:22a (Biro puts a flower on Seaforth's grave)
6/22/25 5:36:22a Coriakin says, "Your teachings have served us in good stead as we've made our way through it..."
6/22/25 5:36:22a Seaforth says, "I charge you to bury me in the family ossuary at Seaforth Castle"
6/22/25 5:36:23a Trillbane says, "Of course, the Arachnoids have ruined some of my libraries."
6/22/25 5:36:23a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:36:23a (Trillbane twitches his whiskers in irritation.)
6/22/25 5:36:23a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:36:23a (Abox ’s ears flick)
6/22/25 5:36:23a Coriakin says, "They seem to do that."
6/22/25 5:36:23a Kevas ponders, "How much is the charge?"
6/22/25 5:36:24a Mr Pudding ponders, "something something darkside... something something Complete"
6/22/25 5:36:24a Katreesa picks up an uli flower.
6/22/25 5:36:24a Sativa says, ":-p"
6/22/25 5:36:25a Coriakin says, "Anyway, we've discovered that we need to get deeper in the citadel than we ever have before"
6/22/25 5:36:26a Naferu growls, "they get a good buzz from the binding glue"
6/22/25 5:36:27a Coriakin says, "And apparently the passages have been sealed, both magically and by collapsing them"
6/22/25 5:36:27a Trillbane asks, "Ah, you'd like me to infiltrate the Citadel and bring back some sort of treasure?"
6/22/25 5:36:27a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:36:28a Inu Teisei asks, "p?"
6/22/25 5:36:28a Trillbane says, "Rest assured, Trillbane is up for the challenge."
6/22/25 5:36:29a Coriakin says, "Actually, we were hoping you might be able to find a path downwards that we could also follow"
6/22/25 5:36:31a Biro ponders, "that's a good plan B"
6/22/25 5:36:31a Garr says, "Yes! I like treasure! I'll split it with you 50/50"
6/22/25 5:36:31a Coriakin says, "Even though that might be a greater challenge"
6/22/25 5:36:33a Kevas ponders, "Some of us are a bit wide. Sorry."
6/22/25 5:36:33a Trillbane ponders, "Considerably more work."
6/22/25 5:36:49a Coriakin says, "After all, I'm sure finding your way down there would be easy for one of your skills"
6/22/25 5:36:50a Trillbane asks, "How deep are we talking?"
6/22/25 5:36:50a Coriakin exclaims, "But finding a path that others could follow, now that would be a challenge!"
6/22/25 5:36:50a Phroon says, "Extremely."
6/22/25 5:36:51a Garr says, "Just to the gates of the moon, maybe slightly deeper"
6/22/25 5:36:52a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "is he saying he can't do it?"
6/22/25 5:36:52a Trillbane says, "Well. It is quite a distance to travel."
6/22/25 5:36:52a Ravenstorm says, "we need a way in and a way out sir"
6/22/25 5:36:52a Coriakin says, "Well, we've encountered these horrible creatures, and they might be... well, what Garr said."
6/22/25 5:36:53a Trillbane says, "And away from my books, leaving them unattended."
6/22/25 5:36:53a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:36:53a (Coriakin nods to Trillbane)
6/22/25 5:36:54a Coriakin says, "We'd be happy to escort you there, if you'd like company on the journey there"
6/22/25 5:36:55a Seaforth says, "I think they are just Thooms and you all are exaggerating"
6/22/25 5:36:56a Trillbane exclaims, "Trillbane has never been bested, but!"
6/22/25 5:36:56a Inu Teisei ponders, "does he want someone to stay behind and guard his books?"
6/22/25 5:36:56a Coriakin says, "Which, I suppose, would be a bit of out character for you but not unheard of"
6/22/25 5:36:56a Naferu says, "to watch and learn your masterful technique, if nothing else"
6/22/25 5:36:57a Trillbane says, "Some sort of compensation might not be amiss."
6/22/25 5:36:57a (Coriakin nods)
6/22/25 5:36:57a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:36:57a Trillbane asks, "Yes. It is masterful, isn't it?"
6/22/25 5:36:58a Garr juggles his orga eye from one hand to the other.
6/22/25 5:36:59a Garr says, "I have this fine Orga eye you might like Trillbane"
6/22/25 5:36:59a Coriakin says, "I'm sure we'd be happy to compensate you for your efforts"
6/22/25 5:36:59a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "slimy?"
6/22/25 5:37:00a Naferu says, "I need to see more to truely be amazed"
6/22/25 5:37:00a Coriakin says, "We have coins, if you are in need..."
6/22/25 5:37:00a (Palmeri looks in her pack)
6/22/25 5:37:01a Coriakin says, "... but if you'd prefer, I might be willing to write a song for you."
6/22/25 5:37:01a Brisk says, "Im willing to chip in as many of Kalian's coins as needed"
6/22/25 5:37:01a Phroon says, "Sounded to me like Trillbane needs a library."
6/22/25 5:37:02a Biro ponders, "send the beautification squad to repair his libraries?"
6/22/25 5:37:02a Palmeri says, "Trillbane, I have a precious neclace if you have an interest"
6/22/25 5:37:02a Garr ponders, "He probably wants books or something... eww"
6/22/25 5:37:02a Trillbane asks, "A song? A necklace?"
6/22/25 5:37:02a Coriakin says, "If you're interested in the arts, at all"
6/22/25 5:37:02a (Trillbane rubs his paws together despite himself.)
6/22/25 5:37:03a Trillbane exclaims, "Now we're talking!"
6/22/25 5:37:03a Seaforth ponders, "How are they tolerating this pompous jerk"
6/22/25 5:37:03a Eirian Caldwell ponders, "I have a very entertaining book about the Laughing Academy"
6/22/25 5:37:04a Trillbane says, "Yes, a song would begin to pay for such an endeavor."
6/22/25 5:37:04a Trillbane asks, "And this necklace! What sort of jewels are set in it?"
6/22/25 5:37:05a Valadorei says, "I think there are books in this place Trillbane."
6/22/25 5:37:05a Noivad exclaims, "duck song!"
6/22/25 5:37:05a (Eirian Caldwell grins.)
6/22/25 5:37:05a Palmeri says, "Rubies"
6/22/25 5:37:06a Naferu shows his armored potion to everyone.
6/22/25 5:37:07a Biro shows her hot air potion to everyone.
6/22/25 5:37:07a Trillbane ponders, "I'd been hoping for topaz, it matches my style better."
6/22/25 5:37:07a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:37:07a (Trillbane shrugs.)
6/22/25 5:37:07a (Palmeri puts the necklace on to show Trillbane)
6/22/25 5:37:08a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:37:08a (Trillbane nods.)
6/22/25 5:37:08a (Naferu misses Topaz)
6/22/25 5:37:09a Biro ponders, "wow, lily fren"
6/22/25 5:37:09a Valadorei says, "You may find something to add to your collection."
6/22/25 5:37:09a Trillbane says, "Very well."
6/22/25 5:37:10a Sativa ponders, "arr"
6/22/25 5:37:10a Trillbane asks, "Then we agreed?"
6/22/25 5:37:10a Noivad ponders, "I miss veer and Yor"
6/22/25 5:37:10a Trillbane asks, "A song, a necklace, and first pick of any books we may find?"
6/22/25 5:37:11a Garr juggles his phial of disgusting liquid from one hand to the other.
6/22/25 5:37:11a (Palmeri nods)
6/22/25 5:37:11a Naferu says, "hmm"
6/22/25 5:37:11a Naferu ponders, "haggle back!"
6/22/25 5:37:12a Garr exclaims, "This is almost as good as topaz!"
6/22/25 5:37:12a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
6/22/25 5:37:13a Kani ponders, "We could stab him just a little."
6/22/25 5:37:13a Coriakin says, "Regarding the books..."
6/22/25 5:37:13a Biro exclaims, "exclude the cursed books from the first pick!"
6/22/25 5:37:14a Coriakin says, "The reason we need to delve so deeply is due to the appearance of some previously unknown creatures"
6/22/25 5:37:15a Garr says, "What kind of books do you like? We could be on the lookout for them"
6/22/25 5:37:15a Palmeri exclaims, "why worry about books when we have weapons!"
6/22/25 5:37:15a Trillbane says, "And perhaps you'd throw in this fellow's armor to sweeten the deal."
6/22/25 5:37:15a Coriakin says, "Horrible things. Look like bone and ash, no heads, too many legs"
6/22/25 5:37:16a Inu Teisei ponders, "Moon Manual?"
6/22/25 5:37:16a (Trillbane nudges Seaforth with his boot.)
6/22/25 5:37:17a Trillbane says, "He won't be needing it."
6/22/25 5:37:17a Coriakin says, "If there are any books that describe such creatures, we may need access to them"
6/22/25 5:37:17a Palmeri asks, "are we going to heal seaforth?"
6/22/25 5:37:19a Inu Teisei ponders, "still det lms"
6/22/25 5:37:32a Garr says, "Also our jewelcrafters don't really know how to work with topaz. I'm not sure we'd be able to get the setting right"
6/22/25 5:37:37a Coriakin says, "Although you're welcome to them once we have the information we need, though"
6/22/25 5:37:43a Coriakin says, "Hmm."
6/22/25 5:37:45a Garr says, "I do have a Topaz we can try on though"
6/22/25 5:37:45a Trillbane says, "Access to my books? So far you've been helping yourself."
6/22/25 5:37:45a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:37:45a Garr juggles his topaz gem from one hand to the other.
6/22/25 5:37:48a (Coriakin chuckles)
6/22/25 5:37:48a (Trillbane eyes the topaz.)
6/22/25 5:37:49a Inu Teisei ponders, "um you were there"
6/22/25 5:37:49a Coriakin says, "Also a Puddleby tradition, I must admit"
6/22/25 5:37:49a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:37:49a Trillbane says, "The ruby necklace, the topaz, Seaforth's armor, a song, and first pick of the books."
6/22/25 5:37:51a Katreesa shows her piece of iron to everyone.
6/22/25 5:37:51a (Coriakin glances at Phroon)
6/22/25 5:37:51a Palmeri asks, "woah woah woah, Topaz AND the necklace?"
6/22/25 5:37:51a Seaforth says, "what."
6/22/25 5:37:51a Katreesa says, ":P"
6/22/25 5:37:51a Inu Teisei ponders, "is he fenengi?"
6/22/25 5:37:51a Kevas ponders, "This deal is getting worse all the time!"
6/22/25 5:37:51a Coriakin says, "This list is getting quite long."
6/22/25 5:37:51a (Phroon shrugs.)
6/22/25 5:37:51a Inu Teisei ponders, "is he fenengi?"
6/22/25 5:37:52a Warawonda ponders, "you offer to much for so little"
6/22/25 5:37:52a Inu Teisei ponders, "is he fenengi?"
6/22/25 5:37:52a Coriakin asks, "Phroon, what say you?"
6/22/25 5:37:52a Trillbane says, "The impossible is possible."
6/22/25 5:37:52a Phroon says, "Uh…"
6/22/25 5:37:52a Garr ponders, "Didn't he already Agree? Now he's just adding more things?"
6/22/25 5:37:53a Brisk says, "I dont have a partridge, but I do have a parrot. There's a pear tree in the orchard too"
6/22/25 5:37:53a Valadorei says, "Also I don't know that we offered first pick..."
6/22/25 5:37:53a Katreesa says, "I hope so"
6/22/25 5:37:54a Phroon says, "Well, I have none of those things to spare myself."
6/22/25 5:37:55a (Garr grins)
6/22/25 5:37:57a Valadorei says, "Oh I can spare Seaforth"
6/22/25 5:37:57a Trillbane asks, "Is it a deal?"
6/22/25 5:37:57a Katreesa says, "as a wanter of impossible things, I hope"
6/22/25 5:37:58a Phroon says, "But the books part sounds reasonable"
6/22/25 5:37:59a Warawonda says, "no"
6/22/25 5:37:59a Seaforth says, "Why does it have to be MY armor"
6/22/25 5:38:00a Palmeri asks, "okay how about this, topaz, a book and if it happens to be a first pick we wont stab you, and you can drag seaforth around for fun?"
6/22/25 5:38:00a Inu Teisei ponders, "shadow tinged moon manual?"
6/22/25 5:38:00a Trillbane says, "You won't be needing it, like I said."
6/22/25 5:38:02a Trillbane says, "You have fallen, and you can't get up."
6/22/25 5:38:05a Seaforth says, "You could have just said SOME armor"
6/22/25 5:38:05a Trillbane says, "You are indisposed."
6/22/25 5:38:07a Eirian Caldwell asks, "why won't he?"
6/22/25 5:38:07a Trillbane says, "You are pining."
6/22/25 5:38:09a Trillbane says, "You are an ex-Champion."
6/22/25 5:38:09a (Abox wonders if he should use the heavy blade)
6/22/25 5:38:12a Dandelion says, "We will raise him in town"
6/22/25 5:38:12a Trillbane says, "You are not, as it were, just resting."
6/22/25 5:38:12a Eirian Caldwell says, "he's just resting"
6/22/25 5:38:13a (Palmeri giggles)
6/22/25 5:38:13a (Shadowfire wheezes in laughter)
6/22/25 5:38:14a Garr ponders, "Hrm... maybe we should have dealt with Injaros instead"
6/22/25 5:38:16a Kevas ponders, "Nah, he just prefers kipping on his back."
6/22/25 5:38:18a * Your mental enhancement fades.
6/22/25 5:38:18a Noivad says, "he's very lazt for a fighter"
6/22/25 5:38:19a Shadowfire says, "'es not dead, 'es pinin' for the fjords"
6/22/25 5:38:19a (Eirian Caldwell snickers.)
6/22/25 5:38:21a Trillbane says, "Palmeri, very well:"
6/22/25 5:38:21a (Biro aspires to trashtalk like Trillbane)
6/22/25 5:38:22a Naferu yells, "Bring out yer dead!"
6/22/25 5:38:23a Katreesa asks, "Maybe we just like stinkin up the joint with a corpse?"
6/22/25 5:38:25a Shadowfire asks, "Why don't we have Biro throw in a free subscription to Bjornhub?"
6/22/25 5:38:25a Seaforth says, "OK. Fine. Since I am a river to my people."
6/22/25 5:38:25a (Naferu hefts an invisible hand wagon)
6/22/25 5:38:25a You have 3865 coins.
6/22/25 5:38:26a Trillbane says, "The topaz, the song, first pick of the books, and it won't be a very good path."
6/22/25 5:39:03a Warawonda says, "no deal"
6/22/25 5:39:04a Trillbane says, "But some of you will be able to see it anyway, since you've studied my techniques."
6/22/25 5:39:05a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar practices throat singing.
6/22/25 5:39:05a Ravenstorm says, "good good"
6/22/25 5:39:05a (Phroon nods.)
6/22/25 5:39:06a Dandelion says, "Dat is a terrible deal"
6/22/25 5:39:06a Inu Teisei's shadowy collar giggles a little bit.
6/22/25 5:39:07a Trillbane says, "No. You're getting the impossible at a price you can afford."
6/22/25 5:39:07a Valadorei ponders, "Wara is insisting he take all of Seaforth not just the armor."
6/22/25 5:39:08a Trillbane says, "It is a magnificent deal."
6/22/25 5:39:08a (Eirian Caldwell laughs.)
6/22/25 5:39:08a (Phroon looks at the laundry list of items building up.)
6/22/25 5:39:09a Warawonda says, "i dout that"
6/22/25 5:39:09a Dandelion says, "You haven't even asked for a golden pear"
6/22/25 5:39:10a Palmeri says, "ugh fine I just want to stab things"
6/22/25 5:39:10a Trillbane says, "You're a mystic, you're just doing your job."

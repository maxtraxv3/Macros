7/20/25 5:36:49a (Phroon grins.)
7/20/25 5:36:49a Kevas says, "Well, he ate something. I can't say for sure what it was."
7/20/25 5:36:49a Ausrine says, "I think that just means we need to eat the Hierophant."
7/20/25 5:36:49a (Thistle waves at Pelaegia behind Tart'targ's back)
7/20/25 5:36:51a Pelaegia (discreetly) waves back at Thistle and smiles encouragingly.

7/20/25 5:36:52a Warawonda asks, "o they grow other places?"
7/20/25 5:36:52a Pe Ell ponders, "Should've used the hierophant's body to grow some more mushrooms"
7/20/25 5:36:53a Aurian exclaims, "more damp?!"

7/20/25 5:36:54a (Phroon nods to Ausrine)
7/20/25 5:36:54a Tart'targ says, "They very well might, but the Vale is where I'd found them locally."
7/20/25 5:36:56a Tart'targ says, "As best I can tell, they'd grow well in aged coniferous forests that are persistently damp."

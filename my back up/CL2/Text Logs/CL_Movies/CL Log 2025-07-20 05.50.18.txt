7/20/25 5:52:05a (Phroon grins.)
7/20/25 5:52:06a Kevas says, "Well, he ate something. I can't say for sure what it was."
7/20/25 5:52:06a Ausrine says, "I think that just means we need to eat the Hierophant."
7/20/25 5:52:06a (Thistle waves at Pelaegia behind Tart'targ's back)
7/20/25 5:52:07a Pelaegia (discreetly) waves back at Thistle and smiles encouragingly.

7/20/25 5:52:09a Warawonda asks, "o they grow other places?"
7/20/25 5:52:09a Pe Ell ponders, "Should've used the hierophant's body to grow some more mushrooms"
7/20/25 5:52:09a Aurian exclaims, "more damp?!"

7/20/25 5:52:10a (Phroon nods to Ausrine)
7/20/25 5:52:11a Tart'targ says, "They very well might, but the Vale is where I'd found them locally."
7/20/25 5:52:12a Tart'targ says, "As best I can tell, they'd grow well in aged coniferous forests that are persistently damp."

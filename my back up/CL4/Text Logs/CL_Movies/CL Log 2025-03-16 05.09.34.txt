3/16/25 5:10:31a Seaforth thinks, "Might need a PF to get Lovsya from West TI"
3/16/25 5:10:31a (Sativa washes off)
3/16/25 5:10:32a (Aurelie remembers she doesn't have PF)

3/16/25 5:18:49a Lugubrion says, "No, Valadorei"
3/16/25 5:18:49a Lugubrion says, "It's is not pure"

3/16/25 5:19:02a Kordal says, "I dunno, when something tries stabbing me, I ain't inclined to invite them over for a drink and whatnot"
3/16/25 5:19:02a Lugubrion asks, "What else did they manage to do?"
3/16/25 5:19:02a (Lov'sya swings his machete at the base of the mirror)
3/16/25 5:19:02a Phroon says, "I would think it must be dismantled slowly, as to not cause any… accidents."
3/16/25 5:19:03a Seaforth exclaims, "Kordal has birthed the concept of "self-necromancy". Summoning your own skeleton. Brilliant!"
3/16/25 5:19:04a Asenath says, "a kyuem with a flame atop around here somewheres"
3/16/25 5:19:04a Coriakin asks, "Perhaps you have some specialists who can assist us with doing so safely?"
3/16/25 5:19:04a (Lov'sya attempts to remove the darkstone from the stand.)
3/16/25 5:19:05a Lugubrion says, "How absurd"
3/16/25 5:19:06a Phroon asks, "Up a level, perhaps?"
3/16/25 5:19:06a Inu Teisei asks, "what?"
3/16/25 5:19:06a Asenath says, "they tried everything, it seems"
3/16/25 5:19:07a Kalian says, "Yeah Phroon"
3/16/25 5:19:07a (Lov'sya hopes for an ethercle)
3/16/25 5:19:08a Seaforth asks, "Lugubrion, have you ever heard of the concept of "self-necromancy"? Summoning your own skeleton?"
3/16/25 5:19:08a Garr says, "Spume, gross"
3/16/25 5:19:09a Seaforth says, "Very convenient."
3/16/25 5:19:10a Lugubrion says, "That sounds easy enough, since one's skeleton is usually present at all times"
3/16/25 5:19:11a Sativa says, "gd nearby"
3/16/25 5:19:11a Kordal asks, "Do these Darkshacs not believe in taking research notes or something?"
3/16/25 5:19:11a Seaforth says, "get your skeleton to do the dishes for you."
3/16/25 5:19:11a You have 21409 coins.
3/16/25 5:19:13a Lugubrion says, "Now, there is no easy way of dismantling this safely"

3/16/25 5:19:13a Inu Teisei asks, "so can we blow them up?"
3/16/25 5:19:14a Ausrine incants in lore.

3/16/25 5:19:14a •You sense healing energy from Hashak.
3/16/25 5:19:16a Lugubrion says, "The hard way involves taking apart piles like this piece by piece."
3/16/25 5:19:16a (Inu Teisei tries her crowbar again)
3/16/25 5:19:17a Phroon says, "Inu, stop"
3/16/25 5:19:17a (Lov'sya attempts to remove an ethercle from the structure.)
3/16/25 5:19:17a Garr says, "We're already good at looting places"
3/16/25 5:19:17a (Sativa tries to bite the ethercle)
3/16/25 5:19:17a Inu Teisei ponders, "hence the crowbar which not workie"
3/16/25 5:19:18a Lugubrion says, "As parts of the pile naturally destabilize, it should be possible to remove ethercles or kyuem pieces"
3/16/25 5:19:19a Lugubrion says, "It will take time"
3/16/25 5:19:19a Ausrine asks, "would we need specialized tools for the job?"

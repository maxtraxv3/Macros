3/23/25 5:24:45a Pe Ell growls, "Well, parachutes also need to have enough room to open. So it also can't be too shallow."

3/23/25 5:24:58a Kevas ponders, "It's probably doom. It's usually doom."
3/23/25 5:24:58a Saxifrage says, "But much of what was known is lost, as is sadly too often the case."
3/23/25 5:24:59a Sativa says, "doom leads to treasure and definitely not the other way around"

3/23/25 5:25:19a Seaforth says, "Delving has never been a mistake, Cori."
3/23/25 5:25:19a Saxifrage says, "It is the Windspinner creed to share the light of knowledge."
3/23/25 5:25:19a Kevas ponders, "Nothing bad ever came from delving too deeply, too greedily."
3/23/25 5:25:20a Sativa says, "useless stuff, like sunstones and altars and catapults and mystics"
3/23/25 5:25:20a Pe Ell says, "Exiles will make the right choice once they've exhausted all other options"

3/23/25 5:25:30a Saxifrage has not disclosed his race, is male, is a Windspinner, and is not wearing the symbol of any clan.
3/23/25 5:25:30a He is holding a wooden shield, and he is wearing a sunstone, an amulet of breath, a cloak and a pair of pants.
3/23/25 5:25:30a (is wearing a tattoo)

3/23/25 5:25:43a Pe Ell ponders, "The Metz Llama?"
3/23/25 5:25:44a Seaforth turns to stone.
3/23/25 5:25:44a Seaforth yells, "1"
3/23/25 5:25:44a Inu Teisei asks, "where is seixfridge?"

3/23/25 5:25:46a Seaforth says, "Un-stone in 3..."
3/23/25 5:25:46a Seaforth says, "Un-stone in 3..."
3/23/25 5:25:46a Shadowfire says, "(May her floofy paws guide us)"
3/23/25 5:25:46a Ausrine says, "if you capture the wind in the parachute from up here, it might be enough to lower you safely down."
3/23/25 5:25:47a Pun'isher growls, "cut it in pieces and give us each a square..if you can spare a square that is"
3/23/25 5:25:47a Clemence ponders, "Bless Hashak as I push him off the edge"
3/23/25 5:25:47a •You notice that you're able to increase others' accuracy more.
3/23/25 5:25:48a Phroon asks, "I'm trying to remember what the smith said of the hear of ice… something about making something from it?"
3/23/25 5:25:48a Ausrine says, "past the places where the wind dies down."
3/23/25 5:25:49a You have 20309 coins.
3/23/25 5:25:49a Pun'isher growls, "snow cones?"

3/23/25 5:25:49a (Phroon tries to remember.)
3/23/25 5:25:50a Kevas says, "Or using it as a tool"
3/23/25 5:25:50a Seaforth says, "Spider silk, steel, heart of ice"
3/23/25 5:25:51a Warawonda ponders, "sounds like mystic armor"
3/23/25 5:25:51a Inu Teisei says, "we haven't seen an actual heart of ice here"
3/23/25 5:25:51a Seaforth ponders, "I think"
3/23/25 5:25:51a Phroon asks, "But it sounds like you described it as a place?"
3/23/25 5:25:52a Sativa says, "or a sweet piece of jewelry to show all your darshak haters"
3/23/25 5:25:52a Clemence says, "we also havent seen Sazi's heart so maybe... it is ice"
3/23/25 5:25:53a Saxifrage says, "Some among you have been trained by our elders, I believe."
3/23/25 5:25:53a Katreesa says, "yes, but maybe we take someone small and strap them to one of them flying critters and throw that down there"
3/23/25 5:25:53a (Ausrine nods)
